<p>This book is intended as a sequel to the Elements of Agriculture,
being a larger and more complete work, containing
fuller directions for the treatment of the different kinds of
soils, for the <i>preparation of manures</i>, and especially for the
drainage of lands, whether level, rolling, hilly, or springy.
Particular attention will be paid to the use of analysis. The
feeding of different animals, and the cultivation of the various
crops, will be described with care.</p>

<p>The size of the work will be about 400 pp. 8vo., and it
will probably be published January 1st, 1856. Price $1.

<h2 class="gap4">TO THE STUDENT.</h2>


<p>This book is presented to you, not as a work of science,
nor as a dry, chemical treatise, but as a plain statement
of the more simple operations by which nature produces
many results, so common to our observation, that we are
thoughtless of their origin. On these results depend the
existence of man and the lower animals. No man should
be ignorant of their production.</p>

<p>In the early prosecution of the study, you will find,
perhaps, nothing to relieve its tediousness; but, when the
foundation of agricultural knowledge is laid in your mind
so thoroughly that you know the character and use of
every stone, then may your thoughts build on it fabrics
of such varied construction, and so varied in their uses,
that there will be opened to you a new world, even more
wonderful and more beautiful than the outward world,
which exhibits itself to the senses. Thus may you live
two lives, each assisting in the enjoyment of the other.</p>

<p>But you may ask the <i>practical</i> use of this. "The
world is made up of little things," saith the proverb. So
with the productive arts. The steam engine consists of
many parts, each part being itself composed of atoms too
minute to be detected by our observation. The earth
itself, in all its solidity and life, consists entirely of atoms<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
too small to be perceived by the naked eye, each visible
particle being an aggregation of thousands of constituent
elements. The crop of wheat, which the farmer raises by
his labor, and sells for money, is produced by a combination
of particles equally small. They are not mysteriously
combined, nor irregularly, but each atom is taken from its
place of deposit, and carried to its required location in the
living plant, by laws as certain as those which regulate the
motion of the engine, or the revolutions of the earth.</p>

<p>It is the business of the practical farmer to put together
these materials, with the assistance of nature. He
may learn her ways, assist her action, and succeed; or he
may remain ignorant of her operations, often counteract
her beneficial influences, and often fail.</p>

<p>A knowledge of the <i>inner</i> world of material things
about us will produce pleasure to the thoughtful, and profit
to the practical.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<h2>THE PLANT.</h2>


<h2 class="gap4">CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h3>INTRODUCTION.</h3>


<div class="sidenote"><p>What is the object of cultivating the soil?</p>

<p>What is necessary in order to cultivate with economy?</p>

<p>Are plants created from nothing?</p></div>

<p>The object of cultivating the soil is to raise from it
a crop of <i>plants</i>. In order to cultivate with economy,
we must <i>raise the largest possible quantity with the
least expense, and without permanent injury to the
soil</i>.</p>

<p>Before this can be done we must study the character
of plants, and learn their exact composition.
They are not <i>created</i> by a mysterious power, they
are merely made up of matters already in existence.
They take up water containing food and other mat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>ters,
and discharge from their roots those substances
that are not required for their growth. It is necessary
for us to know what kind of matter is required
as food for the plant, and where this is to be obtained,
which we can learn only through such means as shall
separate the elements of which plants are composed;
in other words, we must <i>take them apart</i>, and examine
the different pieces of which they are formed.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>What must we do to learn the composition of plants?</p>

<p>What takes place when vegetable matter is burned?</p>

<p>What do we call the two divisions produced by burning?</p>

<p>Where does organic matter originate? Inorganic?</p>

<p>How much of chemistry should farmers know?</p></div>

<p>If we burn any vegetable substance it disappears,
except a small quantity of earthy matter, which we
call <i>ashes</i>. In this way we make an important
division in the constituents of plants. One portion
dissipates into the atmosphere, and the other remains
as ashes.</p>

<p>That part which burns away during combustion
is called <i>organic matter</i>; the ashes are called <i>inorganic
matter</i>. The organic matter has become air,
and hence we conclude that it was originally obtained
from air. The inorganic matter has become earth,
and was obtained from the soil.</p>

<p>This knowledge can do us no good except by the
assistance of chemistry, which explains the properties
of each part, and teaches us where it is to be
found. It is not necessary for farmers to become
chemists. All that is required is, that they should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
know enough of chemistry to understand the nature
of the materials of which their crops are composed,
and how those materials are to be used to the best
advantage.</p>

<p>This amount of knowledge may be easily acquired,
and should be possessed by every person, old or
young, whether actually engaged in the cultivation
of the soil or not. All are dependent on vegetable
productions, not only for food, but for every comfort
and convenience of life. It is the object of this book
to teach children the first principles of agriculture:
and it contains all that is absolutely necessary to an
understanding of the practical operations of cultivation,

<div class="sidenote"><p>Is organic matter lost after combustion?</p>

<p>Of what does it consist?</p>

<p>How large a part of plants is carbon?</p></div>

<p>We will first examine the <i>organic</i> part of plants,
or that which is driven away during combustion or
burning. This matter, though apparently lost, is
only changed in form.</p>

<p>It consists of one solid substance, <i>carbon</i> (or
charcoal), and three gases, <i>oxygen</i>, <i>hydrogen</i> and
<i>nitrogen</i>. These four kinds of matter constitute
nearly the whole of most plants, the ashes forming
often less than one part in one hundred of their dry
weight.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>What do we mean by gas?</p>

<p>Does oxygen unite with other substances?</p>

<p>Give some instances of its combinations</p></div>

<p>When wood is burned in a close vessel, or otherwise
protected from the air, its carbon becomes charcoal.
All plants contain this substance, it forming<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
usually about one half of their dry weight. The remainder
of their organic part consists of the three
gases named above. By the word gas, we mean <i>air</i>.
Oxygen, hydrogen and nitrogen, when pure, are always
in the form of air. Oxygen has the power
of uniting with many substances, forming compounds
which are different from either of their constituents
alone. Thus: oxygen unites with <i>iron</i> and forms
oxide of iron or <i>iron-rust</i>, which does not resemble
the gray metallic iron nor the gas oxygen; oxygen
unites with carbon and forms carbonic acid, which
is an invisible gas, but not at all like pure oxygen;
oxygen combines with hydrogen and forms water.
All of the water, ice, steam, etc., are composed of
these two gases. We know this because we can artificially
decompose, or separate, all water, and obtain
as a result simply oxygen and hydrogen, or we can
combine these two gases and thus form pure water;
oxygen combines with nitrogen and forms nitric
acid. These chemical changes and combinations
take place only under certain circumstances, which,
so far as they affect agriculture, will be considered in
the following pages.</p>

<p>As the organic elements of plants are obtained
from matters existing in the atmosphere which surrounds
our globe, we will examine its constitution.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>



<h2 class="gap4">CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3>ATMOSPHERE.</h3>


<div class="sidenote"><p>What is atmospheric air composed of?</p>

<p>In what proportions?</p>

<p>What is the use of nitrogen in air?</p>

<p>Does the atmosphere contain other matters useful to vegetation?</p>

<p>What are they?</p></div>

<p>Atmospheric air is composed of oxygen and nitrogen.
Their proportions are, one part of oxygen to four
parts of nitrogen. Oxygen is the active agent in
the combustion, decay, and decomposition of organized
bodies (those which have possessed animal or
vegetable life, that is, organic matter), and others
also, in the breathing of animals. Experiments have
proved that if the atmosphere consisted of pure oxygen
every thing would be speedily destroyed, as the
processes of combustion and decay would be greatly
accelerated, and animals would be so stimulated that
death would soon ensue. The use of the nitrogen in
the air is to <i>dilute</i> the oxygen, and thus reduce the
intensity of its effect.</p>

<p>Besides these two great elements, the atmosphere
contains certain impurities which are of great importance
to vegetable growth; these are, <i>carbonic
acid, water, ammonia, etc.</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>


<h3 class="gap2">CARBONIC ACID.</h3>

<div class="sidenote"><p>What is the source of the carbon of plants?</p>

<p>What is carbonic acid?</p>

<p>What is its proportion in the atmosphere?</p>

<p>Where else is it found?</p>

<p>How does it enter the plant?</p>

<p>What are the offices of leaves?</p></div>

<p>Carbonic acid is in all probability the only source
of the carbon of plants, and consequently is of more
importance to vegetation than any other single sort of
food. It is a gas, and is not, under natural circumstances,
perceptible to our senses. It constitutes
about <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2500</sub> of the atmosphere, and is found in combination
with many substances in nature. Marble,
limestone and chalk, are carbonate of lime, or carbonic
acid and lime in combination; and carbonate
of magnesia is a compound of carbonic acid and
magnesia. This gas exists in combination with
many other mineral substances, and is contained in
all water not recently boiled. Its supply, though
small, is sufficient for the purposes of vegetation. It
enters the plant in two ways&mdash;through the roots in
the water which goes to form the sap, and at the
leaves, which absorb it from the air in the form of
gas. The leaf of the plant seems to have three
offices: that of absorbing carbonic acid from the atmosphere&mdash;that
of assisting in the chemical preparation
of the sap&mdash;and that of evaporating its water.
If we examine leaves with a microscope we shall find
that some have as many as 170,000 openings, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
mouths, in a square inch; others have a much less
number. Usually, the pores on the under side of
the leaf absorb the carbonic acid. This absorptive
power is illustrated when we apply the lower side of
a cabbage leaf to a wound, as it draws strongly&mdash;the
other side of the leaf has no such action. Young
sprouts may have the power of absorbing and decomposing
carbonic acid.</p>


<div class="sidenote"><p>What parts of roots absorb food?</p>

<p>How much of their carbon may plants receive through their
roots?</p>

<p>What change does carbonic acid undergo after entering the
plant?</p>

<p>In what parts of the plant, and under what influence, is carbonic
acid decomposed?</p></div>

<p>The roots of plants terminate at their ends in
minute spongioles, or mouths for the absorption of
fluids containing nutriment. In these fluids there
exist greater or less quantities of carbonic acid, and
a considerable amount of this gas enters into the
circulation of the plants and is carried to those parts
where it is required for decomposition. Plants, under
favorable circumstances, may thus obtain about
one-third of their carbon.</p>

<p>Carbonic acid, it will be recollected, consists of
<i>carbon and oxygen</i>, while it supplies only <i>carbon</i>
to the plant. It is therefore necessary that it be
divided, or decomposed, and that the carbon be retained
while the oxygen is sent off again into the
atmosphere, to reperform its office of uniting with
carbon. This decomposition takes place in the <i>green</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
parts of plants and only under the influence of daylight.
It is not necessary that the sun shine directly
on the leaf or green shoot, but this causes a <i>more
rapid</i> decomposition of carbonic acid, and consequently
we find that plants which are well exposed
to the sun's rays make the most rapid growth.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Explain the condition of different latitudes.</p>

<p>Does the proportion of carbonic acid in the atmosphere remain
about the same?</p></div>

<p>The fact that light is essential to vegetation explains
the conditions of different latitudes, which, so
far as the assimilation of carbon is concerned, are
much the same. At the Equator the days are but about
twelve hours long. Still, as the growth of plants is
extended over eight or nine months of the year, the
duration of daylight is sufficient for the requirements
of a luxuriant vegetation. At the Poles, on the contrary,
the summer is but two or three months long;
here, however, it is daylight all summer, and plants
from continual growth develop themselves in that
short time.</p>

<p>It will be recollected that carbonic acid constitutes
but about <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2500</sub> of the air, yet, although
about one half of all the vegetable matter in the
world is derived from this source, as well as all of the
carbon required by the growth of plants, its proportion
in the atmosphere is constantly about the same.
In order that we may understated this, it becomes
necessary for us to consider the means by which
it is formed. Carbon, by the aid of fire, is made to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
unite with oxygen, and always when bodies containing
carbon are burnt <i>with the presence of atmospheric
air</i>, the oxygen of that air unites with the carbon,
and forms carbonic acid. The same occurs when
bodies containing carbon <i>decay</i>, as this is simply a
slower <i>burning</i> and produces the same results. The
respiration (or breathing) of animals is simply the
union of the carbon of the blood with the oxygen of
the air drawn into the lungs, and their breath, when
thrown out, always contains carbonic acid. From
this we see that the reproduction of this gas is the
direct effect of the destruction of all organized bodies,
whether by fire, decay, or consumption by animals.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Explain some of the operations in which this reproduction takes
place.</p>

<p>How is it reproduced?</p></div>

<p>Furnaces are its wholesale manufactories. Every
cottage fire is continually producing a new supply, and
the blue smoke issuing from the cottage-chimney, as
described by so many poets, possesses a new beauty,
when we reflect that besides indicating a cheerful
fire on the hearth, it contains materials for making
food for the cottager's tables and new faggots for his
fire. The wick of every burning lamp draws up the
carbon of the oil to be made into carbonic acid at
the flame. All matters in process of combustion,
decay, fermentation, or putrefaction, are returning to
the atmosphere those constituents, which they obtained
from it. Every living animal, even to the
smallest insect, by respiration, spends its life in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
production of this material necessary to the growth of
plants, and at death gives up its body in part for
such formation by decay.</p>

<p>Thus we see that there is a continual change from
the carbon of plants to air, and from air back to
plants, or through them to animals. As each dollar
in gold that is received into a country permanently
increases its amount of circulating medium, and each
dollar sent out permanently decreases it until returned,
so the carbonic acid sent into the atmosphere
by burning, decay, or respiration, becomes a permanent
stock of constantly changeable material, until it shall
be locked up for a time, as in a house which may last
for centuries, or in an oak tree which may stand for
thousands of years. Still, at the decay of either of
these, the carbon which they contain must be again
resolved into carbonic acid.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>What are the coal-beds of Pennsylvania?</p>

<p>What are often found in them?</p></div>

<p>The coal-beds of Pennsylvania are mines of
carbon once abstracted from the atmosphere by
plants. In these coal-beds are often found fern
leaves, toads, whole trees, and in short all forms of
organized matter. These all existed as living things
before the great floods, and at the breaking away of
the barriers of the immense lakes, of which our present
lakes were merely the deep holes in their beds,
they were washed away and deposited in masses so
great as to take fire from their chemical changes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
It is by many supposed that this fire acting throughout
the entire mass (without the presence of air <i>to
supply oxygen</i> except on the surface) caused it to
become melted carbon, and to flow around those
bodies which still retained their shapes, changing
them to coal without destroying their structures.
This coal, so long as it retains its present form, is
lost to the vegetable kingdom, and each ton that is
burned, by being changed into carbonic acid, adds to
the ability of the atmosphere to support an increased
amount of vegetation.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Explain the manner in which they become coal.</p>

<p>How does the burning of coal benefit vegetation?</p>

<p>Is carbon ever permanent in any of its forms?</p>

<p>What enables it to change its condition?</p></div>

<p>Thus we see that, in the provisions of nature,
carbon, the grand basis, on which all organized
matter is founded, is never permanent in any of
its forms. Oxygen is the carrier which enables it to
change its condition. For instance, let us suppose
that we have a certain quantity of charcoal;
this is nearly pure carbon. We ignite it, and
it unites with the oxygen of the air, becomes carbonic
acid, and floats away into the atmosphere. The
wind carries it through a forest, and the leaves of the
trees with their millions of mouths drink it in. By
the assistance of light it is decomposed, the oxygen
is sent off to make more carbonic acid, and the carbon
is retained to form a part of the tree. So long as that
tree exists in the form of wood, the carbon will re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>main
unaltered, but when the wood decays, or is
burned, it immediately takes the form of carbonic
acid, and mingles with the atmosphere ready to be
again taken up by plants, and have its carbon deposited
in the form of vegetable matter.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Give an instance of such change.</p>

<p>How do plants and animals benefit each other?</p>

<p>Describe the experiment with the glass tube.</p></div>

<p>The blood of animals contains carbon derived
from their food. This unites with the oxygen of the
air drawn into the lungs and forms carbonic acid.
Without this process, animals could not live. Thus,
while by the natural operation of breathing, they
make carbonic acid for the uses of the vegetable
world, plants, in taking up carbon, throw off oxygen
to keep up the life of animals. There is perhaps no
way in which we can better illustrate the changes of
form in carbon than by describing a simple experiment.</p>

<p>Take a glass tube filled with oxygen gas, and
put in it a lump of charcoal, cork the ends of the
tube tightly, and pass through the corks the wires of
an electrical battery. By passing a stream of electrical
fluid over the charcoal it may be ignited, when it
will burn with great brilliancy. In burning it is dissolved
in the oxygen forming carbonic acid, and disappears.
It is no more lost, however, than is the
carbon of wood which is burned in a stove; although
invisible, it is still in the tube, and may be detected
by careful weighing. A more satisfactory proof of its
presence may be obtained by <i>decomposing</i> the car<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>bonic
acid by drawing the wires a short distance apart,
and giving a <i>spark</i> of electricity. This immediately
separates the oxygen from the carbon which forms a
dense black smoke in the tube. By pushing the
corks together we may obtain a wafer of charcoal of
the same weight as the piece introduced. In this
experiment we have changed carbon from its solid
form to an invisible gas and back again to a solid,
thus fully representing the continual changes of this
substance in the destruction of organic matter and
the growth of plants.</p>

<h3>HYDROGEN, OXYGEN AND NITROGEN.</h3>


<h3 class="gap2">HYDROGEN AND OXYGEN.</h3>

<div class="sidenote"><p>What is water composed of?</p>

<p>If analyzed, what does it yield?</p>

<p>How do plants obtain their hydrogen and oxygen?</p></div>

<p>Let us now consider the three gases, <i>hydrogen</i>,
<i>oxygen</i> and <i>nitrogen</i>, which constitute the remainder
of the organic part of plants.</p>

<p>Hydrogen and oxygen compose <i>water</i>, which, if
analyzed, yields simply these two gases. Plants perform
such analysis, and in this way are able to obtain
a sufficient supply of these materials, as their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
sap is composed chiefly of water. Whenever vegetable
matter is destroyed by burning, decay, or
otherwise, its hydrogen and oxygen unite and form
water, which is parted with usually in the form of an
invisible vapor. The atmosphere of course contains
greater or less quantities of watery vapor arising from
this cause and from the evaporation of liquid water.
This vapor condenses, forming rains, etc.</p>

<p>Hydrogen and oxygen are never taken into consideration
in manuring lands, as they are so readily
obtained from the water constituting the sap of the
plant, and consequently should not occupy our attention
in this book.</p>


<h3 class="gap2">NITROGEN.</h3>

<div class="sidenote"><p>If vegetable matter be destroyed, what becomes of these constituents?</p>

<p>What is the remaining organic constituent?</p>

<p>Why is it worthy of close attention?</p>

<p>Do plants appropriate the nitrogen of the atmosphere?</p></div>

<p><i>Nitrogen</i>, the only remaining <i>organic</i> constituent
of vegetable matter, is for many reasons worthy of close
attention.</p>

<p>1. It is necessary to the growth and perfection of
all cultivated plants.</p>

<p>2. It is necessary to the formation of animal
muscle.</p>

<p>3. It is often deficient in the soil.</p>

<p>4. It is liable to be easily lost from manures.</p>

<p>Although about four fifths of atmospheric air
are pure nitrogen, it is almost certain that plants<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
get no nutriment at all from this source. It is all
obtained from some of its compounds, chiefly from
the one called ammonia. Nitric acid is also a source
from which plants may obtain nitrogen, though to
the farmer of less importance than ammonia.</p>


<h3 class="gap2">AMMONIA.</h3>

<div class="sidenote"><p>What is the principal source from which they obtain nitrogen?</p>

<p>What is ammonia?</p>

<p>How is it formed?</p>

<p>Where does it always exist?</p>

<p>How do plants take up ammonia?</p></div>

<p><i>Ammonia</i> is composed of nitrogen and hydrogen.
It has a pungent smell and is familiarly known as
<i>hartshorn</i>. The same odor is perceptible around
stables and other places where animal matter is decomposing.
All animal muscle, certain parts of
plants, and other organized substances, consist of
compounds containing nitrogen. When these compounds
undergo combustion, or are in any manner
decomposed, the nitrogen which they contain usually
unites with hydrogen, and forms ammonia. In consequence
of this the atmosphere always contains
more or less of this gas, arising from the decay, etc.,
which is continually going on all over the world.</p>

<p>This ammonia in the atmosphere is the capital
stock to which all plants, not artificially manured,
must look for their supply of nitrogen. As they can
take up ammonia only through their roots, we must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
discover some means by which it may be conveyed
from the atmosphere to the soil.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Does water absorb it?</p>

<p>What is <i>spirits of hartshorn</i>?</p>

<p>Why is this power of water important in agriculture?</p>

<p>What instance may be cited to prove this?</p></div>

<p>Water may be made to absorb many times its
bulk of this gas, and water with which it comes in
contact will immediately take it up. Spirits of
hartshorn is merely water through which ammonia
has been passed until it is saturated.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> This power
of water has a direct application to agriculture,
because the water constituting rains, dews, &amp;c.,
absorbs the ammonia which the decomposition of
nitrogenous matter had sent into the atmosphere,
and we find that all rain, snow and dew, contain
ammonia. This fact may be chemically proved in
various ways, and is perceptible in the common
operations of nature. Every person must have
noticed that when a summer's shower falls on the
plants in a flower garden, they commence their
growth with fresh vigor while the blossoms become
larger and more richly colored. This effect cannot be
produced by watering with spring water, unless it be
previously mixed with ammonia, in which case the
result will be the same.</p>

<p>Although ammonia is a gas and pervades the
atmosphere, few, if any, plants can take it up, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
they do carbonic acid, through their leaves. It
must all enter through the roots in solution in the
water which goes to form the sap. Although the
amount received from the atmosphere is of great
importance, there are few cases where artificial applications
are not beneficial. The value of farm-yard
and other animal manures, depends chiefly on the
ammonia which they yield on decomposition. This
subject, also the means for retaining in the soil the
ammoniacal parts of fertilizing matters, will be fully
considered in the section on manures.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Can plants use more ammonia than is received from the atmosphere?</p>

<p>On what does the value of animal manure chiefly depend?</p>

<p>What changes take place after ammonia enters the plant?</p>

<p>May the same atom of nitrogen perform many different offices?</p></div>

<p>After ammonia has entered the plant it may
be decomposed, its hydrogen sent off, and its
nitrogen retained to answer the purposes of growth.
The changes which nitrogen undergoes, from plants
to animals, or, by decomposition, to the form of
ammonia in the atmosphere, are as varied as those of
carbon and the constituents of water. The same
little atom of nitrogen may one year form a part of a
plant, and the next become a constituent of an animal,
or, with the decomposed dead animal, may form a
part of the soil. If the animal should fall into the
sea he may become food for fishes, and our atom of
nitrogen may form a part of a fish. That fish may
be eaten by a larger one, or at death may become<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
food for the whale, through the marine insect, on
which it feeds. After the abstraction of the oil from
the whale, the nitrogen may, by the putrefaction of
his remains, be united to hydrogen, form ammonia,
and escape into the atmosphere. From here it may
be brought to the soil by rains, and enter into the
composition of a plant, from which, could its parts
speak as it lies on our table, it could tell us a wonderful
tale of travels, and assure us that, after wandering
about in all sorts of places, it had returned to
us the same little atom of nitrogen which we had
owned twenty years before, and which for thousands
of years had been continually going through its
changes.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Is the same true of the other constituents of plants?</p>

<p>Is any atom of matter ever lost?</p></div>

<p>The same is true of any of the organic or inorganic
constituents of plants. They are performing
their natural offices, or are lying in the earth, or
floating in the atmosphere, ready to be lent to <i>any</i>
of their legitimate uses, sure again to be returned to
their starting point.</p>

<p>Thus no atom of matter is ever lost. It may
change its place, but it remains for ever as a part of
the capital of nature.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<h3>INORGANIC MATTER.</h3>


<div class="sidenote"><p>What are ashes called?</p>

<p>How many kinds of matter are there in the ashes of plants?</p>

<p>Into what three classes may they be divided?</p>

<p>What takes place when alkalies and acids are brought together?</p></div>

<p>We will now examine the ashes left after burning
vegetable substances. This we have called inorganic
matter, and it is obtained from the soil. Organic
matter, although forming so large a part of the plant,
we have seen to consist of four different substances.
The inorganic portion, on the contrary, although
forming so small a part, consists of no less than <i>nine</i>
or <i>ten</i> different kinds of matter.<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> These we will consider
in order. In their relations to agriculture
they may be divided into <i>three</i> classes&mdash;<i>alkalies</i>, <i>acids</i>,
and <i>neutrals</i>.<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Is the character of a compound the same as that of its constituents?</p>

<p>Give an instance of this.</p>

<p>Do neutrals combine with other substances?</p>

<p>Name the four alkalies found in the ashes of plants.</p></div>

<p>Alkalies and acids are of opposite properties, and
when brought together they unite and neutralize
each other, forming compounds which are neither alkaline
nor acid in their character. Thus, carbonic
acid (a gas,) unites with lime&mdash;a burning, caustic
substance&mdash;and forms marble, which is a hard taste<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>less
stone. Alkalies and acids are characterized by
their desire to unite with each other, and the compounds
thus formed have many and various properties,
so that the characters of the constituents give
no indication of the character of the compound.
For instance, lime causes the gases of animal manure
to escape, while sulphate of lime (a compound of
sulphuric acid and lime) produces an opposite effect,
and prevents their escape.</p>

<p>The substances coming under the signification of
neutrals, are less affected by the laws of combination,
still they often combine feebly with other substances,
and some of the resultant compounds are of great
importance to agriculture.</p>


<h3 class="gap2">ALKALIES.</h3>

<p>The alkalies which are found in the ashes of
plants are four in number; they are <i>potash</i>, <i>soda</i>,
<i>lime</i> and <i>magnesia</i>.</p>


<h3 class="gap2">POTASH.</h3>

<div class="sidenote"><p>How may we obtain potash from ashes?</p>

<p>What are some of its agricultural uses?</p></div>

<p>When we pour water over wood ashes it dissolves
the <i>potash</i> which they contain, and carries it through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
in solution. This solution is called <i>ley</i>, and if it be
boiled to dryness it leaves a solid substance from
which pure potash may be made. Potash left exposed
to the air absorbs carbonic acid and becomes
carbonate of potash, or <i>pearlash</i>; if another atom of
carbonic acid be added, it becomes super-carbonate of
potash, or <i>sal&aelig;ratus</i>. Potash has many uses in agriculture.</p>

<p>1. It forms a constituent of nearly all plants.</p>

<p>2. It unites with silica (a neutral), and forms a
compound which water can dissolve and carry into
the roots of plants; thus supplying them with an
ingredient which gives them much of their strength.<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a></p>

<p>3. It is a strong agent in the decomposition of
vegetable matter, and is thus of much importance in
preparing manures.</p>

<p>4. It roughens the smooth round particles of
sandy soils, and prevents their compacting, as they
are often liable to do.</p>

<p>5. It is also of use in killing certain kinds of
insects, and, when artificially applied, in smoothing
the bark of fruit trees.</p>

<p>The source from which this and the other inor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>ganic

<h3 class="gap2">SODA.</h3>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Where is soda found most largely?</p>

<p>What is Glauber's salts?</p>

<p>What is washing soda?</p>

<p>What are some of the uses of lime?</p></div>

<p><i>Soda</i>, one of the alkalies contained in the ashes
of plants, is very much the same as potash in its
agricultural character. Its uses are the same as
those of potash&mdash;before enumerated. Soda exists
very largely in nature, as it forms an important part
of common salt, whether in the ocean or in those inland
deposits known as rock salt. When combined
with sulphuric acid it forms sulphate of soda or <i>Glauber's
salts</i>. In combination with carbonic acid, as
carbonate of soda, it forms the common washing soda
of the shops. It is often necessary to render soils fertile.</p>


<h3 class="gap2">LIME.</h3>

<p><i>Lime</i> is in many ways important in agriculture:</p>

<p>1. It is a constituent of plants and animals.</p>

<p>2. It assists in the decomposition of vegetable
matter in the soil.</p>

<p>3. It corrects the acidity<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a> of sour soils.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>
<p>4. As chloride or sulphate of lime it is a good
absorbent of fertilizing gases.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>How is caustic lime made?</p>

<p>How much carbonic acid is thus liberated?</p>

<p>How does man resemble Sinbad the sailor?</p></div>

<p>In nature it usually exists in the form of carbonate
of lime: that is, as marble, limestone, and
chalk&mdash;these all being of the same composition. In
manufacturing caustic (or quick) lime, it is customary
to burn the carbonate of lime in a kiln; by this
means the carbonic acid is thrown off into the atmosphere
and the lime remains in a pure or caustic state.
A French chemist states that every cubic yard of
limestone that is burned, throws off <i>ten thousand</i>
cubic yards of carbonic acid, which may be used by
plants. This reminds us of the story of Sinbad the
sailor, where we read of the immense <i>genie</i> who came
out of a very small box by the sea-shore, much to the
surprise of Sinbad, who could not believe his eyes,
until the <i>genie</i> changed himself into a cloud of smoke
and went into the box again. Sinbad fastened the
lid, and the <i>genie</i> must have remained there until the
box was destroyed.</p>

<p>Now man is very much like Sinbad, he lets the
carbonic acid out from the limestone (when it expands
and becomes a gas); and then he raises a
crop, the leaves of which drink it in and pack the
carbon away in a very small compass as vegetable
matter. Here it must remain until the plant is de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>stroyed,
when it becomes carbonic acid again, and
occupies just as much space as ever.</p>

<p>The burning of limestone is a very prolific source
of carbonic acid.</p>


<h3 class="gap2">MAGNESIA.</h3>

<div class="sidenote"><p>What do you know about magnesia?</p>

<p>What is phosphoric acid composed of?</p>

<p>With what substance does it form its most important compound?</p></div>

<p><i>Magnesia</i> is the remaining alkali of vegetable
ashes. It is well known as a medicine, both in the
form of calcined magnesia, and, when mixed with sulphuric
acid, as epsom salts.</p>

<p>Magnesia is necessary to nearly all plants, but
too much of it is poisonous, and it should be used
with much care, as many soils already contain a sufficient
quantity. It is often found in limestone rocks
(that class called <i>dolomites</i>), and the injurious effects
of some kinds of lime, as well as the barrenness of
soils made from dolomites, may be attributed entirely
to the fact that they contain too much magnesia.</p>


<h3 class="gap2">ACIDS.</h3>

<h3 class="gap2">PHOSPHORIC ACID.</h3>

<p><i>Phosphoric acid.</i>&mdash;This subject is one of the
greatest interest to the farmer. Phosphoric acid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
is composed of phosphorus and oxygen. The
end of a loco-foco match contains phosphorus, and
when it is lighted it unites with the oxygen of the
atmosphere and forms phosphoric acid; this constitutes
the white smoke which is seen for a moment
before the sulphur commences burning. Being an
acid, this substance has the power of combining with
any of the alkalies. Its most important compound
is with lime.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Will soils, deficient in phosphate of lime, produce good crops?</p>

<p>From what source do plants obtain their phosphorus?</p></div>

<p><i>Phosphate of lime</i> forms about 65 per cent.
of the dry weight of the bones of all animals, and
it is all derived from the soil through the medium
of plants. As plants are intended as food for
animals, nature has provided that they shall not
attain their perfection without taking up a supply
of phosphate of lime as well as of the other
earthy matters; consequently, there are many soils
which will not produce good crops, simply because
they are deficient in phosphate of lime. It is one of
the most important ingredients of manures, and its
value is dependent on certain conditions which will
be hereafter explained.</p>

<p>Another use of phosphoric acid in the plant is
to supply it with a small amount of <i>phosphorus</i>,
which seems to be required in the formation of the
seed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>


<h3 class="gap2">SULPHURIC ACID.</h3>

<div class="sidenote"><p>What is sulphuric acid composed of?</p>

<p>What is plaster?</p>

<p>What is silica?</p>

<p>Why is it necessary to the growth of plants?</p>

<p>What compounds does it form with alkalies?</p></div>

<p><i>Sulphuric acid</i> is important to vegetation and is
often needed to render soils fertile. It is composed
of sulphur and oxygen, and is made for manufacturing
purposes, by burning sulphur. With lime it forms
<i>sulphate of lime</i>, which is gypsum or 'plaster.' In
this form it is often found in nature, and is generally
used in agriculture. Other important methods for
supplying sulphuric acid will be described hereafter.
It gives <i>to</i> the plant a small portion of <i>sulphur</i>,
which is necessary to the formation of some of its
parts.</p>


<h3 class="gap2">NEUTRALS.</h3>

<h3 class="gap2">SILICA.</h3>

<div class="sidenote"><p>How can you prove its existence in corn stalks?</p>

<p>What instance does Liebig give to show its existence in grass?</p>

<p>How do we supply silicates?</p>

<p>Why does grain lodge?</p>

<p>What is the most important compound of chlorine?</p></div>

<p>This is sand, the base of flint. It is necessary
for the growth of all plants, as it gives them much
of their strength. In connection with an alkali it
constitutes the hard shining surface of corn stalks,
straw, etc. Silica unites with the alkalies and forms
compounds, such as <i>silicate of potash</i>, <i>silicate of
soda, etc.</i>, which are soluble in water, and therefore<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
available to plants. If we roughen a corn stalk
with sand-paper we may sharpen a knife upon it.
This is owing to the hard particles of silica which it
contains. Window glass is silicate of potash, rendered
insoluble by additions of arsenic and litharge.</p>

<p>Liebig tells us that some persons discovered,
between Manheim and Heidelberg in Germany, a
mass of melted glass where a hay-stack had been
struck by lightning. They supposed it to be a
meteor, but chemical analysis showed that it was only
the compound of silica and potash which served to
strengthen the grass.</p>

<p>There is always <i>enough</i> silica in the soil, but it
is often necessary to add an alkali to render it available.
When grain, etc., lodge or fall down from
their own weight, it is altogether probable that they
are unable to obtain from the soil a sufficient supply
of the soluble silicates, and some form of alkali
should be added to the soil to unite with the sand
and render it soluble.</p>


<h3 class="gap2">CHLORINE.</h3>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Of what use is chloride of lime?</p>

<p>What is oxide of iron?</p>

<p>What is the difference between the <i>per</i>oxide and the <i>prot</i>oxide
of iron?</p></div>

<p><i>Chlorine</i> is an important ingredient of vegetable
ashes, and is often required to restore the balance to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
the soil. It is not found alone in nature, but is
always in combination with other substances. Its
most important compound is with sodium, forming
<i>chloride of sodium</i> (or common salt). Sodium is the
base of soda, and common salt is usually the best
source from which to obtain both soda and chlorine.
Chlorine unites with lime and forms <i>chloride of lime</i>,
which is much used to absorb the unpleasant odors
of decaying matters, and in this character it is of use
in the treatment of manures.</p>


<h3 class="gap2">OXIDE OF IRON.</h3>

<p><i>Oxide of iron</i>, one of the constituents of ashes, is
common iron rust. <i>Iron</i> itself is naturally of a
grayish color, but when exposed to the atmosphere,
it readily absorbs oxygen and forms a reddish compound.
It is in this form that it usually exists in
nature, and many soils as well as the red sandstones
are colored by it. It is seldom, if ever, necessary to
apply this as a manure, there being usually enough
of it in the soil.</p>

<p>This red oxide of iron, of which we have been
speaking, is called by chemists the <i>peroxide</i>. There
is another compound which contains less oxygen than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
this, and is called the <i>protoxide of iron</i>, which is
poisonous to plants. When it exists in the soil it is
necessary to use such means of cultivation as shall
expose it to the atmosphere and allow it to take up
more oxygen and become the peroxide. The black
scales which fly from hot iron when struck by the
blacksmith's hammer are protoxide of iron.</p>

<p>The <i>peroxide of iron</i> is a very good absorbent of
ammonia, and consequently, as will be hereafter
described, adds to the fertility of the soil.</p>

<h3>GROWTH.</h3>


<div class="sidenote"><p>Of what does a perfect young plant consist?</p>

<p>How must the food of plants be supplied?</p>

<p>Can carbon and earthy matter be taken up at separate stages
of growth, or must they both be supplied at once?</p></div>

<p>Having examined the materials of which plants
are made, it becomes necessary to discover how they
are put together in the process of growth. Let us
therefore suppose a young wheat-plant for instance
to be in condition to commence independent growth.</p>

<p>It consists of roots which are located in the soil;
leaves which are spread in the air, and a stem which
connects the roots and leaves. This stem contains
sap vessels (or tubes) which extend from the
ends of the roots to the surfaces of the leaves, thus
affording a passage for the sap, and consequently
allowing the matters taken up to be distributed
throughout the plant.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>What seems to be nature's law with regard to this?</p>

<p>What is the similarity between making a cart and raising a crop?</p>

<p>In the growth of a young plant, what operations take place
about the same time?</p></div>

<p>It is necessary that the materials of which plants
are made should be supplied in certain proportions,
and at the same time. For instance, carbon
could not be taken up in large quantities by the
leaves, unless the roots, at the same time, were receiving
from the soil those mineral matters which are
necessary to growth. On the other hand, no con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>siderable
amount of earthy matter could be appropriated
by the roots unless the leaves were obtaining
carbon from the air. This same rule holds true with
regard to all of the constituents required; Nature
seeming to have made it a law that if one of the
important ingredients of the plant is absent, the
others, though they may be present in sufficient
quantities, cannot be used. Thus, if the soil is deficient
in potash, and still has sufficient quantities
of all of the other ingredients, the plant cannot take
up these ingredients, because potash is necessary to
its life.</p>

<p>If a farmer wishes to make a cart he prepares his
wood and iron, gets them all in the proper condition,
and then can very readily put them together. But
if he has all of the <i>wood</i> necessary and no <i>iron</i>, he
cannot make his cart, because bolts, nails and screws
are required, and their place cannot be supplied by
boards. This serves to illustrate the fact that in
raising plants we must give them every thing that
they require, or they will not grow at all.</p>

<p>In the case of our young plant the following operations
are going on at about the same time.</p>

<p>The leaves are absorbing carbonic acid from the
atmosphere, and the roots are drinking in water from
the soil.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>What becomes of the carbonic acid?</p>

<p>How is the sap disposed of?</p>

<p>What does it contain?</p>

<p>How does the plant obtain its carbon?</p>

<p>Its oxygen and hydrogen?</p>

<p>Its nitrogen?</p>

<p>Its inorganic matter?</p></div>

<p>Under the influence of daylight, the carbonic acid
is decomposed; its oxygen returned to the atmosphere,
and its carbon retained in the plant.</p>

<p>The water taken in by the roots circulates
through the sap vessels of the plant, and, from
various causes, is drawn up towards the leaves where
it is evaporated. This water contains the <i>nitrogen</i>
and the <i>inorganic matter</i> required by the plant and
some carbonic acid, while the water itself consists of
<i>hydrogen</i> and <i>oxygen</i>.</p>

<p>Thus we see that the plant obtains its food in the
following manner:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="">
<tr>
<td><span class="smcap">Carbon.</span></td>
<td>&mdash;</td>
<td>In the form of <i>carbonic acid</i> from the atmosphere, and from
that contained in the sap, the oxygen being returned to the
air.</td>

<tr>

<td>&mdash;</td>
<td>From the elements of the water constituting the sap.</td>

</tr>
</table>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>What changes does the food taken up by the plant undergo?</p></div>

<p>Many of the chemical changes which take place
in the interior of the plant are well understood, but
they require too much knowledge of chemistry to be
easily comprehended by the young learner, and it is
not absolutely essential that they should be understood
by the scholar who is merely learning the
<i>elements</i> of the science.</p>

<p>It is sufficient to say that the food taken up by the
plant undergoes such changes as are required for its
growth; as in animals, where the food taken into the
stomach, is digested, and formed into bone, muscle,
fat, hair, etc., so in the plant the nutritive portions of
the sap are resolved into wood, bark, grain, or some
other necessary part.</p>

<p>The results of these changes are of the greatest
importance in agriculture, and no person can call
himself a <i>practical farmer</i> who does not thoroughly
understand them.</p>



<h2 class="gap4">CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3>PROXIMATE DIVISION OF PLANTS, ETC.</h3>


<p>We have hitherto examined what is called the
<i>ultimate</i> division of plants. That is, we have looked
at each one of the elements separately, and considered
its use in vegetable growth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Of what do wood, starch and the other vegetable compounds
chiefly consist?</p>

<p>Are their small ashy parts important?</p>

<p>What are these compounds called?</p>

<p>Into how many classes may proximate principles be divided?</p>

<p>Of what do the first class consist? The second?</p>

<p>What vegetable compounds do the first class comprise?</p></div>

<p>We will now examine another division of plants,
called their <i>proximate division</i>. We know that
plants consist of various substances, such as wood,
gum, starch, oil, etc., and on examination we shall
discover that these substances are composed of the
various <i>organic</i> and <i>inorganic</i> ingredients described
in the preceding chapters. They are made up almost
entirely of <i>organic</i> matter, but their ashy parts,
though very small, are (as we shall soon see) sometimes
of great importance.</p>

<p>These compounds are called <i>proximate principles</i>,<a name="FNanchor_G_7" id="FNanchor_G_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a>
or <i>vegetable proximates</i>. They may be divided
into two classes.</p>

<p>The first class are composed of <i>carbon</i>, <i>hydrogen</i>,
and <i>oxygen</i>.</p>

<p>The second class contain the same substances
and <i>nitrogen</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Are these substances of about the same composition?</p>

<p>Can they be artificially changed from one to another?</p>

<p>Give an instance of this.</p>

<p>Is the ease with which these changes take place important?</p>

<p>From what may the first class of proximates be formed?</p></div>

<p>The first class (those compounds not containing
nitrogen) comprise the wood, starch, gum, sugar, and
fatty matter which constitute the greater part of all
plants, also the acids which are found in sour fruits,
etc. Various as are all of these things in their charac<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>ters,
they are entirely composed of the same ingredients
(carbon, hydrogen and oxygen), and usually
combined in about the <i>same proportion</i>. There may
be a slight difference in the composition of their <i>ashes</i>,
but the organic part is much the same in every case,
so much so, that they can often be artificially changed
from one to the other.</p>

<p>As an instance of this, it may be recollected by
those who attended the Fair of the American Institute,
in 1834, that Prof. Mapes exhibited samples
of excellent sugar made from the juice of the cornstalk,
starch, linen, and woody fibre.</p>

<p>The ease with which these proximates may be
changed from one to the other is their most important
agricultural feature, and should be clearly
understood before proceeding farther. It is one of
the fundamental principles on which the growth of
both vegetables depends.</p>

<p>The proximates of the first class constitute usually
the greater part of all plants, and they are readily
formed from the carbonic acid and water which in
nature are so plentifully supplied.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Why are those of the second class particularly important to
farmers?</p>

<p>What is the general name under which they are known?</p>

<p>What is the protein of wheat called?</p>

<p>Why is flour containing much gluten preferred by bakers?</p>

<p>Can protein be formed without nitrogen?</p>

<p>If plants were allowed to complete their growth without a supply
of this ingredient, what would be the result?</p></div>

<p>The <i>second class</i> of proximates, though forming
only a small part of the plant, are of the greatest
importance to the farmer, being the ones from which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
<i>animal muscle</i><a name="FNanchor_H_8" id="FNanchor_H_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a> is made. They consist, as will be recollected,
of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and <i>nitrogen</i>,
or of <i>all</i> of the organic elements of plants. They are
all of much the same character, though each kind of
plant has its peculiar form of this substance, which is
known under the general name of <i>protein</i>.</p>

<p>The protein of wheat is called <i>gluten</i>&mdash;that of
Indian corn is <i>zein</i>&mdash;that of beans and peas is <i>legumin</i>.
In other plants the protein substances are <i>vegetable
albumen</i>, <i>casein</i>, etc.</p>

<p>Gluten absorbs large quantities of water, which
causes it to swell to a great size, and become full of
holes. Flour which contains much gluten, makes
light, porous bread, and is preferred by bakers,
because it absorbs so large an amount of water.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>What is the result if a field be deficient in nitrogen?</p></div>

<p>The protein substances are necessary to animal
and vegetable life, and none of our cultivated plants
will attain maturity (complete their growth), unless
allowed the materials required for forming this constituent.
To furnish this condition is the object of
nitrogen given to plants as manure. If no <i>nitrogen</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
is supplied the protein substances cannot be formed,
and the plant must cease to grow.</p>

<p>When on the contrary <i>ammonia</i> is given to the
soil (by rains or otherwise), it furnishes nitrogen,
while the carbonic acid and water yield the other
constituents of protein, and a healthy growth continues,
provided that the soil contains the <i>mineral</i>
matters required in the formation of the ash, in a
condition to be useful.</p>

<p>The wisdom of this provision is evident when we
recollect that the protein substances are necessary to
the formation of muscle in animals, for if plants were
allowed to complete their growth without a supply of
this ingredient, our grain and hay might not be sufficiently
well supplied with it to keep our oxen and
horses in working condition, while under the existing
law plants must be of nearly a uniform quality (in
this respect), and if a field is short of nitrogen, its
crop will not be large, and of a very poor quality, but
the soil will produce good plants as long as the nitrogen
lasts, and then the growth must cease.<a name="FNanchor_I_9" id="FNanchor_I_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a></p>


<h3 class="gap2">ANIMALS.</h3>

<p>That this principle may be clearly understood, it
may be well to explain more fully the application of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
the proximate constituents of plants in feeding
animals.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Of what are the bodies of animals composed?</p>

<p>What is the office of vegetation?</p>

<p>What part of the animal is formed from the first class of proximates?</p>

<p>From the second?</p>

<p>Which contains the largest portions of inorganic matter, plants
or animals?</p>

<p>Must animals have a variety of food, and why?</p></div>

<p>Animals are composed (like plants) of organic
and inorganic matter, and every thing necessary to
build them up exists in plants. It seems to be
the office of the vegetable world to prepare the gases
in the atmosphere, and the minerals in the earth for
the uses of animal life, and to effect this plants put
these gases and minerals together in the form of the
various <i>proximates</i> (or compound substances) which
we have just described.</p>

<p>In animals the compounds containing <i>no nitrogen</i>
comprise the fatty substances, parts of the blood, etc.,
while the protein compound, or those which <i>do contain
nitrogen</i>, form the muscle, a part of the bones,
the hair, and other portions of the animal.</p>

<p>Animals contain a larger proportion of inorganic
matter than plants do. Bones contain a large
quantity of phosphate of lime, and we find other
inorganic materials performing important offices in
the system.</p>

<p>In order that animals may be perfectly developed,
they must of course receive as food all of the materials
required to form their bodies. They cannot live if
fed entirely on one ingredient. Thus, if <i>starch</i> alone<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
be eaten by the animal, he might become <i>fat</i>, but his
strength would soon fail, because his food contains
nothing to keep up the vigor of his <i>muscles</i>. If on
the contrary the food of an animal consisted entirely
of <i>gluten</i>, he might be very strong from a superior development
of muscle, but would not be fat. Hence
we see that in order to keep up the proper proportion
of both fat and muscle in our animals (or in ourselves),
the food must be such as contains a proper proportion
of the two kinds of proximates.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Why is grain good for food?</p>

<p>On what does the value of flour depend?</p>

<p>Is there any relation between the ashy part of plants and
those of animals?</p>

<p>How may we account for unhealthy bones and teeth?</p></div>

<p>It is for this reason that grain, such as wheat for
instance, is so good for food. It contains both
classes of proximates, and furnishes material for the
formation of both fat and muscle. The value of <i>flour</i>
depends very much on the manner in which it is
manufactured. This will be soon explained.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>What is a probable cause of consumption?</p>

<p>What is an important use of the first class of proximates?</p>

<p>What may lungs be called?</p>

<p>Explain the production of heat during decomposition.</p>

<p>Why is the heat produced by decay not perceptible?</p></div>

<p>Apart from the relations between the <i>proximate
principles</i> of plants, and those of animals, there exists
an important relation between their <i>ashy</i> or <i>inorganic</i>
parts; and, food in order to satisfy the demands of
animal life, must contain the mineral matter required
for the purposes of that life. Take bones for instance.
If phosphate of lime is not always supplied in sufficient
quantities by food, animals are prevented from
the formation of healthy bones. This is particularly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
to be noticed in teeth. Where food is deficient of
phosphate of lime, we see poor teeth as a result.
Some physicians have supposed that one of the causes
of consumption is the deficiency of phosphate of lime
in food.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Why is the heat produced by combustion apparent?</p>

<p>Explain the production of heat in the lungs of animals?</p>

<p>Why does exercise augment the animal heat?</p>

<p>Under what circumstances is the animal's own fat used in the
production of heat?</p></div>

<p>The first class of proximates (starch, sugar, gum,
etc.), perform an important office in the animal
economy aside from their use in making fat. They
constitute the <i>fuel</i> which supplies the animal's fire,
and gives him his <i>heat</i>. The lungs of men and other
animals may be called delicate <i>stoves</i>, which supply
the whole body with heat. But let us explain this
matter more fully. If wood, starch, gum, or sugar,
be burned in a stove, they produce heat. These
substances consist, as will be recollected, of carbon,
hydrogen, and oxygen, and when they are destroyed
in any way (provided they be exposed to the atmosphere),
the hydrogen and oxygen unite and form
water, and the carbon unites with the oxygen of the air
and forms carbonic acid, as was explained in a preceding
chapter. This process is always accompanied
by the liberation of <i>heat</i>, and the <i>intensity</i> of this
heat depends on the <i>time</i> occupied in its <i>production</i>.
In the case of decay, the chemical changes take place
so slowly that the heat, being conducted away as soon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
as formed, is not perceptible to our senses. In combustion
(or burning) the same changes take place
with much greater rapidity, and the same <i>amount</i>
of heat being concentrated, or brought out in a
far shorter time, it becomes intense, and therefore
apparent. In the lungs of animals the same law holds
true. The blood contains matters belonging to this
carbonaceous class, and they undergo in the lungs the
changes which have been described under the head of
combustion and decay. Their hydrogen and oxygen
unite, and form the moisture of the breath, while
their carbon is combined with the oxygen of the air
drawn into the lungs, and is thrown out as carbonic
acid. The same consequence&mdash;heat&mdash;results in this,
as in the other cases, and this heat is produced with
sufficient rapidity for the animal necessities. When
an animal exercises violently, his blood circulates
with increased rapidity, thus carrying carbon more
rapidly to the lungs. The breath also becomes
quicker, thus supplying increased quantities of
oxygen. In this way the decomposition becomes
more rapid, and the animal is heated in proportion.</p>

<p>Thus we see that food has another function
besides that of forming animal matter, namely to
supply heat. When the food does not contain a
sufficient quantity of starch, sugar, etc., to answer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
the demands of the system the <i>animal's own fat</i> is
carried to the lungs, and there used in the production
of heat. This important fact will be referred to
again.</p>

<h3>LOCATION OF THE PROXIMATES AND VARIATIONS
IN THE ASHES OF PLANTS.</h3>


<div class="sidenote"><p>Of what proximate are plants chiefly composed?</p>

<p>What is the principal constituent of the potato root?</p>

<p>Of the carrot and turnip?</p>

<p>What part of the plant contains usually the most nutriment?</p></div>

<p>Let us now examine plants with a view to learning
the <i>location</i> of the various plants.</p>

<p>The stem or trunk of the plant or tree consists
almost entirely of <i>woody fibre</i>; this also forms a large
portion of the other parts except the seeds, and, in
some instances, the roots. The roots of the potato
contain large quantities of <i>starch</i>. Other roots such
as the <i>carrot</i> and <i>turnip</i> contain <i>pectic acid</i>,<a name="FNanchor_J_10" id="FNanchor_J_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_J_10" class="fnanchor">[J]</a> a
nutritious substance resembling starch.</p>

<p>It is in the <i>seed</i> however that the more nutritive
portions of most plants exist, and here they maintain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
certain relative positions which it is well to understand,
and which can be best explained by reference
to the following figures, as described by Prof.
Johnston:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 596px;">
<img src="images/fig001.png" width="596" height="263" alt="Fig. 1." title="" />
<span class="caption">Fig. 1.</span>
</div>

<p>"Thus <i>a</i> shows the position of the oil in the outer
part of the seed&mdash;it exists in minute drops, inclosed
in six-sided cells, which consists chiefly of gluten; <i>b</i>,
the position and comparative quantity of the starch,
which in the heart of the seed is mixed with only a
small proportion of gluten; <i>c</i>, the germ or chit which
contains much gluten."<a name="FNanchor_K_11" id="FNanchor_K_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_K_11" class="fnanchor">[K]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Is the composition of the inorganic matter of different parts of
the plant the same, or different?</p>

<p>What is the difference between the ash of the straw and that
of the grain of wheat?</p></div>

<p>The location of the <i>inorganic</i> part of plants is one
of much interest, and shows the adaptation of each
part to its particular use. Take a wheat plant, for
instance&mdash;the stalk, the leaf, and the grain, show in
their ashes, important difference of composition.
The stalk or straw contains three or four times as
large a proportion of ash as the grain, and a no less
remarkable difference of composition may be noticed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
in the ashes of the two parts. In that of the straw,
we find a large proportion of silica and scarcely any
phosphoric acid, while in that of the grain there is
scarcely a trace of silica, although phosphoric acid
constitutes more than one half of the entire weight.
The leaves contain a considerable quantity of lime.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>What is the reason for this difference?</p>

<p>In what part of the grain does phosphoric acid exist most
largely?</p></div>

<p>This may at first seem an unimportant matter,
but on examination we shall see the use of it. The
straw is intended to support the grain and leaves,
and to convey the sap from the roots to the upper
portions of the plant. To perform these offices,
<i>strength</i> is required, and this is given by the <i>silica</i>,
and the woody fibre which forms so large a proportion
of the stalk. The silica is combined with an
alkali, and constitutes the glassy coating of the straw.
While the plant is young, this coating is hardly apparent,
but as it grows older, as the grain becomes
heavier, (verging towards ripeness), the silicious
coating of the stalk assumes a more prominent character,
and gives to the straw sufficient strength to
support the golden head. The straw is not the most
important part of the plant as <i>food</i>, and therefore
requires but little phosphoric acid.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Why is Graham flour more wholesome than fine flour?</p>

<p>Are the ashes of all plants the same in their composition?</p></div>

<p>The grain, on the contrary, is especially intended
as food, and therefore must contain a large proportion
of phosphoric acid&mdash;this being, as we have al<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>ready
learned, necessary to the formation of bone&mdash;while,
as it has no necessity for strength, and as
silica is not needed by animals, this ingredient exists
in the grain only in a very small proportion. It may
be well to observe that the phosphoric acid of grain
exists most largely in the hard portions near the
shell, or bran. This is one of the reasons why Graham
flour is more wholesome than fine flour. It
contains all of the nutritive materials which render
the grain valuable as food, while flour which is very
finely bolted<a name="FNanchor_L_12" id="FNanchor_L_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_L_12" class="fnanchor">[L]</a> contains only a small part of the outer
portions of the grain (where the phosphoric acid,
protein and fatty matters exist most largely). The
starchy matter in the interior of the grain, which is
the least capable of giving strength to the animal, is
carefully separated, and used as food for man, while
the better portions, not being ground so finely, are
rejected. This one thing alone may be sufficient to
account for the fact, that the lives of men have become
shorter and less blessed with health and strength,
than they were in the good old days when a stone
mortar and a coarse sieve made a respectable flour
mill.</p>

<p>Another important fact concerning the ashes of
plants is the difference of their composition in different
plants. Thus, the most prominent ingredient in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
the ash of the potato is <i>potash</i>; of wheat and other
grains, <i>phosphoric acid</i>; of meadow hay, <i>silica</i>; of
clover, <i>lime</i>; of beans, <i>potash</i>, etc. In grain, <i>potash</i>
(or <i>soda</i>), etc., are among the important ingredients.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Of what advantage are these differences to the farmer?</p>

<p>Of what are plants composed?</p></div>

<p>These differences are of great importance to the
practical farmer, as by understanding what kind of
plants use the most of one ingredient, and what kind
requires another in large proportion, he can regulate
his crops so as to prevent his soil from being exhausted
more in one ingredient than in the others, and
can also manure his land with reference to the crop
which he intends to grow. The tables of analyses
in the fifth section will point out these differences
accurately.</p>

<h3>RECAPITULATION.</h3>


<p>We have now learned as much about the plant as is
required for our immediate uses, and we will carefully
reconsider the various points with a view to fixing
them permanently in the mind.</p>

<p>Plants are composed of <i>organic</i> and <i>inorganic</i>
matter.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>What is organic matter? Inorganic?</p>

<p>Of what does organic matter consist? Inorganic?</p>

<p>How do plants obtain their organic food?</p>

<p>How their inorganic?</p>

<p>How is ammonia supplied? Carbonic acid?</p></div>

<p>Organic matter is that which burns away in the
fire. Inorganic matter is the ash left after burning.</p>

<p>The organic matter of plants consists of three
gases, oxygen, hydrogen and nitrogen, and one solid
substance carbon (or charcoal). The inorganic
matter of plants consists of potash, soda, lime,
magnesia, sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid, chlorine,
silica, oxide of iron, and oxide of manganese.</p>

<p>Plants obtain their organic food as follows:&mdash;Oxygen
and hydrogen from water, nitrogen from
some compound containing nitrogen (chiefly from
ammonia), and carbon from the atmosphere where it
exists as carbonic acid&mdash;a gas.</p>

<p>They obtain their inorganic food from the soil.</p>

<p>The water which supplies oxygen and hydrogen
to plants is readily obtained without the assistance
of manures.</p>

<p>Ammonia is obtained from the atmosphere, by
being absorbed by rain and carried into the soil, and it
enters plants through their roots. It may be artificially
supplied in the form of animal manure with
profit.</p>

<p>Carbonic acid is absorbed from the atmosphere by
leaves, and decomposed in the green parts of plants
under the influence of daylight; the carbon is re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>tained,
and the oxygen is returned to the atmosphere.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>When plants are destroyed by combustion or decay, what becomes
of their constituents?</p>

<p>How does the inorganic matter enter the plant?</p>

<p>Are the alkalies soluble in their pure forms?</p>

<p>Which one of them is injurious when too largely present?</p>

<p>How may sulphuric acid be supplied?</p>

<p>Is phosphoric acid important?</p>

<p>How must silica be treated?</p>

<p>From what source may we obtain chlorine?</p></div>

<p>When plants are destroyed by decay, or burning,
their organic constituents pass away as water,
ammonia, carbonic acid, etc., ready again to be taken
up by other plants.</p>

<p>The inorganic matters in the soil can enter the
plant only when dissolved in water. <i>Potash</i>, <i>soda</i>,
<i>lime</i>, and <i>magnesia</i>, are soluble in their pure
forms. Magnesia is injurious when present in too
large quantities.</p>

<p><i>Sulphuric</i> acid is often necessary as a manure,
and is usually most available in the form of sulphate of
lime or plaster. It is also valuable in its pure form
to prevent the escape of ammonia from composts.</p>

<p><i>Phosphoric</i> acid is highly important, from its
frequent deficiency in worn-out soils. It is available
only under certain conditions which will be described
in the section on manures.</p>

<p><i>Silica</i> is the base of common sand, and must be
united to an alkali before it can be used by the plant,
because it is insoluble except when so united.</p>

<p><i>Chlorine</i> is a constituent of common salt (chloride<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
of sodium), and from this source may be obtained in
sufficient quantities for manurial purposes.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>What is the difference between <i>per</i>oxide and <i>prot</i>oxide of iron?</p>

<p>How must the food of plants be supplied?</p>

<p>What takes place after it enters the plant?</p>

<p>What name is given to the compounds thus formed?</p>

<p>How are proximates divided?</p>

<p>Which class constitutes the largest part of the plant?</p>

<p>Of what are animals composed, and how do they obtain the
materials from which to form their growth?</p></div>

<p><i>Oxide of iron</i> is iron rust. There are two oxides
of iron, the <i>peroxide</i> (red) and the <i>protoxide</i> (black).
The former is a fertilizer, and the latter poisons
plants.</p>

<p><i>Oxide of manganese</i> is often absent from the
ashes of our cultivated plants.</p>

<p>The food of plants, both organic and inorganic,
must be supplied in certain proportions, and at the
time when it is required. In the plant, this food
undergoes such chemical changes as are necessary to
growth.</p>

<p>The compounds formed by these chemical combinations
are called <i>proximates</i>.</p>

<p>Proximates are of two classes, those not containing
nitrogen, and those which do contain it.</p>

<p>The first class constitute nearly the whole plant.</p>

<p>The second class, although small in quantity, are
of the greatest importance to the farmer, as from
them all animal muscle is made.</p>

<p>Animals, like plants, are composed of both organic
and inorganic matter, and their bodies are
obtained directly or indirectly from plants.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>What parts of the animal belong to the first class of proximates?</p>

<p>What to the second?</p>

<p>What is necessary to the perfect development of animals?</p>

<p>Why are seeds valuable for working animals?</p>

<p>What other important use, in animal economy, have proximates
of the first class?</p>

<p>Under what circumstances is animal fat decomposed?</p></div>

<p>The first class of proximates in animals comprise
the fat, and like tissues.</p>

<p>The second class form the muscle, hair, gelatine
of the bones, etc.</p>

<p>In order that they may be perfectly developed,
animals must eat both classes of proximates, and in
the proportions required by their natures.</p>

<p>They require the phosphate of lime and other inorganic
food which exist in plants.</p>

<p>Seeds are the best adapted to the uses of working
animals, because they are rich in all kinds of food required.</p>

<p>Aside from their use in the formation of <i>fat</i>,
proximates of the first class are employed in the
lungs, as fuel to keep up animal heat, which is produced
(as in fire and decay) by the decomposition of
these substances.</p>

<p>When the food is insufficient for the purposes of
heat, the animal's own fat is decomposed, and carried
to the lungs as fuel.</p>

<p>The stems, roots, branches, etc., of most plants
consist principally of <i>woody fibre</i>.</p>

<p>Their seeds, and sometimes their roots, contain
considerable quantities of <i>starch</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Name the parts of the plant in which the different proximates
exist.</p>

<p>State what you know about flour.</p>

<p>Do we know that different plants have ashes of different composition?</p></div>

<p>The <i>protein</i> and the <i>oils</i> of most plants exist
most largely in the <i>seeds</i>.</p>

<p>The location of the proximates, as well as of the
inorganic parts of the plant, show a remarkable reference
to the purposes of growth, and to the wants
of the animal world, as is noticed in the difference
between the construction of the straw and that of
the kernel of wheat.</p>

<p>The reason why the fine flour now made is not so
healthfully nutritious as that which contained more of
the coarse portions, is that it is robbed of a large
proportion of protein and phosphate of lime, while
it contains an undue amount of starch, which is available
only to form fat, and to supply fuel to the
lungs.</p>

<p>Different plants have ashes of different composition.
Thus&mdash;one may take from the soil large quantities
of potash, another of phosphoric acid, and
another of lime.</p>

<p>By understanding these differences, we shall be
able so to regulate our rotations, that the soil
may not be called on to supply more of one ingredient
than of another, and thus it may be kept
in balance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<h2>THE SOIL.</h2>




<h2 class="gap4">CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h3>FORMATION AND CHARACTER OF THE
SOIL.</h3>


<div class="sidenote"><p>What is a necessary condition of growth?</p></div>

<p>In the foregoing section, we have studied the character
of plants and the laws which govern their
growth. We learned that one necessary condition for
growth is a fertile soil, and therefore we will examine
the nature of different soils, in order that we
may understand the relations between them and
plants.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>What is a fixed character of soils?</p>

<p>How is the chemical character of the soil to be ascertained?</p>

<p>What do we first learn in analyzing a soil?</p>

<p>How do the proportions of organic or inorganic parts of soils
compare with those of plants?</p>

<p>Of what does the organic part of soils consist?</p></div>

<p>The soil is not to be regarded as a mysterious
mass of dirt, whereon crops are produced by a
mysterious process. Well ascertained scientific<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
knowledge has proved beyond question that all soils,
whether in America or Asia, whether in Maine or
California, have certain fixed properties, which render
them fertile or barren, and the science of agriculture
is able to point out these characteristics in all cases, so
that we can ascertain from a scientific investigation
what would be the chances for success in cultivating
any soil which we examine.</p>

<p>The soil is a great chemical compound, and its
chemical character is ascertained (as in the case of
plants) by analyzing it, or taking it apart.</p>

<p>We first learn that fertile soils contain both organic
and inorganic matter; but, unlike the plant,
they usually possess much more of the latter than of
the former.</p>

<p>In the plant, the organic matter constitutes the
most considerable portion of the whole. In the soil,
on the contrary, it usually exists in very small quantities,
while the inorganic portions constitute nearly
the whole bulk.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Can the required proportion be definitely indicated?</p>

<p>From what source is the inorganic part of soils derived?</p>

<p>Do all soils decompose with equal facility?</p>

<p>How does frost affect rocks?</p>

<p>Does it affect soils in the same way?</p></div>

<p>The organic part of soils consists of the same
materials that constitute the organic part of the
plants, and it is in reality decayed vegetable and
animal matter. It is not necessary that this organic
part of the soil should form any particular proportion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
of the whole, and indeed we find it varying from one
and a half to fifty, and sometimes, in peaty soils, to
over seventy per cent. All fertile soils contain some
organic matter, although it seems to make but little
difference in fertility, whether it be ten or fifty per
cent.</p>

<p>The inorganic part of soils is derived from the
crumbling of rocks. Some rocks (such as the slates
in Central New York) decompose, and crumble rapidly
on being exposed to the weather; while
granite, marble, and other rocks will last for a long
time without perceptible change. The <i>causes</i> of this
crumbling are various, and are not unimportant to
the agriculturist; as by the same processes by which
his soil was formed, he can increase its depth, or
otherwise improve it. This being the case, we will
in a few words explain some of the principal pulverizing
agents.</p>

<p>1. The action of frost. When water lodges
in the crevices of rocks, and <i>freezes</i>, it expands,
and bursts the rock, on the same principle as
causes it to break a pitcher in winter. This
power is very great, and by its assistance, large
cannon may be burst. Of course the action of frost
is the same on a small scale as when applied to large<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
masses of matter, and, therefore, we find that when
water freezes in the <i>pores</i><a name="FNanchor_M_13" id="FNanchor_M_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_M_13" class="fnanchor">[M]</a> of rocks or stones, it separates
their particles and causes them to crumble.
The same rule holds true with regard to stiff clay
soils. If they are <i>ridged</i> in autumn, and left with a
rough surface exposed to the frosts of winter, they
will become much lighter, and can afterwards be
worked with less difficulty.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>What is the effect of water on certain rocks?</p>

<p>How are some rocks affected by exposure to the atmosphere?
Give an instance of this.</p></div>

<p>2. The action of water. Many kinds of rock
become so soft on being soaked with water, that they
readily crumble.</p>

<p>3. The chemical changes of the constituents of
the rock. Many kinds of rock are affected by exposure
to the atmosphere, in such a manner, that
changes take place in their chemical character, and
cause them to fall to pieces. The red kellis of New
Jersey (a species of sandstone), is, when first quarried,
a very hard stone, but on exposure to the influences
of the atmosphere, it becomes so soft that
it may be easily crushed between the thumb and
finger.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>What is the similarity between the composition of soils and the
rocks from which they were formed?</p>

<p>What does feldspar rock yield? Talcose slate? Marls?</p>

<p>Does a soil formed entirely from rock contain organic matter?</p>

<p>How is it affected by the growth of plants?</p></div>

<p>Other actions, of a less simple kind, exert an influence
on the stubbornness of rocks, and cause them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
to be resolved into soils.<a name="FNanchor_N_14" id="FNanchor_N_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_N_14" class="fnanchor">[N]</a> Of course, the composition
of the soil must be similar to that of the rock
from which it was formed; and, consequently, if we
know the chemical character of the rock, we can tell
whether the soil formed from it can be brought
under profitable cultivation. Thus feldspar, on being
pulverized, yields potash; talcose slate yields magnesia;
marls yield lime, etc.</p>

<p>The soil formed entirely from rock, contains, of
course, no organic matter.<a name="FNanchor_O_15" id="FNanchor_O_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_O_15" class="fnanchor">[O]</a> Still it is capable of
bearing plants of a certain class, and when these die,
they are deposited in the soil, and thus form its
organic portions, rendering it capable of supporting
those plants which furnish food for animals. Thousands
of years must have been occupied in preparing
the earth for habitation by man.</p>

<p>As the inorganic or mineral part of the soil is
usually the largest, we will consider it first.</p>

<p>As we have stated that this portion is formed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
from rocks, we will examine their character, with a
view to showing the different qualities of soils.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>What is the general rule concerning the composition of rocks?</p>

<p>Do these distinctions affect the fertility of soils formed from
them?</p>

<p>What do we mean by the mechanical character of the soil?</p>

<p>Is its fertility indicated by its mechanical character?</p></div>

<p>As a general rule, it may be stated that <i>all rocks
are either sandstones, limestones, or clays; or a mixture
of two or more of these ingredients</i>. Hence we
find that all mineral soils are either <i>sandy</i>, <i>calcareous</i>,
(limey), or <i>clayey</i>; or consist of a mixture of these,
in which one or another usually predominates. Thus,
we speak of a sandy soil, a clay soil, etc. These
distinctions (sandy, clayey, loamy, etc.) are important
in considering the <i>mechanical</i> character of the
soil, but have little reference to its fertility.</p>

<p>By <i>mechanical</i> character, we mean those qualities
which affect the ease of cultivation&mdash;excess or
deficiency of water, ability to withstand drought, etc.
For instance, a heavy clay soil is difficult to plow&mdash;retains
water after rains, and bakes quite hard during
drought; while a light sandy soil is plowed with ease,
often allows water to pass through immediately after
rains, and becomes dry and powdery during drought.
Notwithstanding those differences in their mechanical
character, both soils may be very fertile, or one
more so than the other, without reference to the clay
and sand which they contain, and which, to <i>our observation</i>,
form their leading characteristics. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
same facts exist with regard to a loam, a calcareous
(or limey) soil, or a vegetable mould. Their mechanical
texture is not essentially an index to their
fertility, nor to the manures required to enable them
to furnish food to plants. It is true, that each kind
of soil appears to have some general quality of fertility
or barrenness which is well known to practical
men, yet this is not founded on the fact that the clay
or the sand, or the vegetable matter, enter more largely
into the constitution of plants than they do when
they are not present in so great quantities, but on certain
other facts which will be hereafter explained.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>What is a sandy soil? A clay soil? A loamy soil? A marl?
A calcareous soil? A peaty soil?</p></div>

<p>As the following names are used to denote the
character of soils, in ordinary agricultural description,
we will briefly explain their application:</p>

<p>A <i>Sandy soil</i> is, of course, one in which sand
largely predominates.</p>

<p><i>Clay soil</i>, one where <i>clay</i> forms a large proportion
of the soil.</p>

<p><i>Loamy soil</i>, where sand and clay are about equally
mixed.</p>

<p><i>Marl</i> contains from five to twenty per cent. of
carbonate of lime.</p>

<p><i>Calcareous soil</i> more than twenty per cent.</p>

<p><i>Peaty soils</i>, of course, contain large quantities of
organic matter.<a name="FNanchor_P_16" id="FNanchor_P_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_P_16" class="fnanchor">[P]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>How large a part of the soil may be used as food by plants?</p>

<p>What do we learn from the analyses of barren and fertile soils?</p></div>

<p>We will now take under consideration that part
of the soil on which depends its ability to supply
food to the plant. This portion rarely constitutes
more than five or ten per cent. of the entire soil, sometimes
less&mdash;and it has no reference to the sand, clay,
and vegetable matters which they contain. From
analyses of many fertile soils, and of others which are
barren or of poorer quality, it has been ascertained
that the presence of certain ingredients is necessary
to fertility. This may be better explained by the assistance
of the following table:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>What can you say of the soils represented in the table of analyses?</p>

<p>What proportion of the fertilizing ingredients is required?</p>

<p>If the soil represented in the third column contained all the ingredients
required except potash and soda, would it be fertile?</p>

<p>What would be necessary to make it so?</p>

<p>What is the reason for this?</p>

<p>What are the offices performed by the inorganic part of soils?</p></div>

<p>The soil represented in the first column might
still be fertile with less organic matter, or with a
larger proportion of clay (alumina), and less sand
(silica). These affect its <i>mechanical</i> character; but,
if we look down the column, we notice that there are
small quantities of lime, magnesia, and the other constituents
of the ashes of plants (except ox. of
manganese). It is not necessary that they should be
present in the soil in the exact quantity named above,
but <i>not one must be entirely absent, or greatly reduced
in proportion</i>. By referring to the third
column, we see that these ingredients are not all
present, and the soil is barren. Even if it were
supplied with all but one or two, potash and soda
for instance, it could not support a crop without the
assistance of manures containing these alkalies. The
reason for this must be readily seen, as we have learned
that no plant can arrive at maturity without the
necessary supply of materials required in the formation
of the ash, and these materials can be obtained
only from the soil; consequently, when they do not
exist there, it must be barren.</p>

<p>The inorganic part of soils has two distinct
offices to perform. The clay and sand form a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
mass of material into which roots can penetrate, and
thus plants are supported in their position. These
parts also absorb heat, air and moisture to serve the
purposes of growth, as we shall see in a future
chapter. The minute portions of soil, which comprise
the acids, alkalies, and neutrals, furnish plants
with their ashes, and are the most necessary to
the fertility of the soil.</p>


<h3 class="gap2">GEOLOGY.</h3>

<div class="sidenote"><p>What is geology?</p>

<p>Is the same kind of rock always of the same composition?</p>

<p>How do rocks differ?</p></div>

<p>The relation between the inorganic part of soils
and the rocks from which it was formed, is the
foundation of Agricultural Geology. Geology
may be briefly named the <i>science of rocks</i>. It would
not be proper in an elementary work to introduce much
of this study, and we will therefore simply state that
the same kind of rock is of the same composition all
over the world; consequently, if we find a soil in
New England formed from any particular rock, and a
soil from the same rock in Asia, their natural fertility
will be the same in both localities. Some rocks
consist of a mixture of different kinds of minerals;
and some, consisting chiefly of one ingredient, are of
different degrees of <i>hardness</i>. Both of these changes
must affect the character of the soil, but it may be
laid down as rule that, <i>when the rocks of two loca<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>tions
are exactly alike, the soils formed from them
will be of the same natural fertility, and in proportion
as the character of rocks changes, in the same
proportion will the soils differ</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>What rule may be given in relation to soils formed from the
same or different rocks?</p>

<p>Are all soils formed from the rocks on which they lie?</p>

<p>What instances can you give of this?</p></div>

<p>In most districts the soil is formed from the rock
on which it lies; but this is not always the case.
Soils are often formed by deposits of matter brought
by water from other localities. Thus the alluvial
banks of rivers consist of matters brought from the
country through which the rivers have passed. The
river Nile, in Egypt, yearly overflows its banks,
and deposits large quantities of mud brought from
the uninhabited upper countries. The prairies of the
West owe a portion of their soil to deposits by
water. Swamps often receive the washings of adjacent
hills; and, in these cases, their soil is derived
from a foreign source.</p>

<p>We might continue to enumerate instances of the
relations between soils and the sources whence they
originated, thus demonstrating more fully the importance
of geology to the farmer; but it would be
beyond the scope of this work, and should be investigated
by scholars more advanced than those
who are studying merely the <i>elements</i> of agricultural
science.</p>

<p>The mind, in its early application to any branch<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
of study, should not be charged with intricate
subjects. It should master well the <i>rudiments</i>,
before investigating those matters which should
<i>follow</i> such understanding.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>In what light will plants and soils be regarded by those who
understand them?</p></div>

<p>By pursuing the proper course, it is easy to learn
all that is necessary to form a good foundation for a
thorough acquaintance with the subject. If this
foundation is laid thoroughly, the learner will regard
plants and soils as old acquaintances, with whose
formation and properties he is as familiar as with
the construction of a building or simple machine. A
simple spear of grass will become an object of
interest, forming itself into a perfect plant, with full
development of roots, stem, leaves, and seeds, by
processes with which he feels acquainted. The soil
will cease to be mere dirt; it will be viewed as a
compound substance, whose composition is a matter
of interest, and whose care is productive of intellectual
pleasure. The commencement of study in any
science must necessarily be wearisome to the young
mind, but its more advanced stages amply repay the
trouble of early exertions.</p>

<h3>USES OF ORGANIC MATTER.</h3>


<div class="sidenote"><p>What proportion of organic matter is required for fertility?</p>

<p>How does the soil obtain its organic matter?</p>

<p>How does the growth of clover, etc., affect the soil?</p></div>

<p>It will be recollected that, in addition to its mineral
portions, the soil contains organic matter in varied
quantities. It may be fertile with but one and a half
per cent. of organic matter, and some peaty soils contain
more than fifty per cent. or more than one half
of the whole.</p>

<p>The precise amount necessary cannot be fixed
at any particular sum; perhaps five parts in a
hundred would be as good a quantity as could be
recommended.</p>

<p>The soil obtains its organic matter in two ways.
First, by the decay of roots and dead plants, also of
leaves, which have been brought to it by wind, etc.
Second, by the application of organic manures.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>When organic matter decays in the soil, what becomes of it?</p>

<p>Is charcoal taken up by plants?</p>

<p>Are humus and humic acid of great practical importance?</p></div>

<p>When a crop of clover is raised, it obtains its
carbon from the atmosphere; and, if it be plowed
under, and allowed to decay, a portion of this carbon
is deposited in the soil. Carbon constitutes nearly
the whole of the dry weight of the clover, aside from
the constituents of water; and, when we calculate
the immense quantity of hay, and roots grown on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
an acre of soil in a single season, we shall find that
the amount of carbon thus deposited is immense.
If the clover had been removed, and the roots only
left to decay, the amount of carbon deposited would
still have been very great. The same is true in all
cases where the crop is removed, and the roots remain
to form the organic or vegetable part of the
soil. While undergoing decomposition, a portion of
this matter escapes in the form of gas, and the remainder
chiefly assumes the form of carbon (or
charcoal), in which form it will always remain,
without loss, unless driven out by fire. If a bushel
of charcoal be mixed with the soil now, it will be the
same bushel of charcoal, neither more nor less, a
thousand years hence, unless some influence is brought
to bear on it aside from the growth of plants. It is
true that, in the case of the decomposition of organic
matter in the soil, certain compounds are
formed, known under the general names of <i>humus</i>
and <i>humic acid</i>, which may, in a slight degree, affect
the growth of plants, but their practical importance
is of too doubtful a character to justify us in considering
them. The application of manures, containing
organic matter, such as peat, muck, animal
manure, etc., supplies the soil with carbon on the
same principle, and the decomposing matters also<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
generate<a name="FNanchor_Q_17" id="FNanchor_Q_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_Q_17" class="fnanchor">[Q]</a> carbonic acid gas while being decomposed.
The agricultural value of carbon in the soil depends
(as we have stated), not on the fact that it enters into
the composition of plants, but on certain other
important offices which it performs, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>On what does the agricultural value of the carbon in the soil
depend?</p>

<p>Why does it make the soil more retentive of manure?</p>

<p>What is the experiment with the barrels of sand?</p></div>

<p>1. It makes the soil more retentive of manures.</p>

<p>2. It causes it to appropriate larger quantities of
the fertilizing gases of the atmosphere.</p>

<p>3. It gives it greater power to absorb moisture.</p>

<p>4. It renders it warmer.</p>

<p>1. Carbon (or charcoal) makes the soil retentive
of manures, because it has in itself a strong power to
absorb, and retain<a name="FNanchor_R_18" id="FNanchor_R_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_R_18" class="fnanchor">[R]</a> fertilizing matters. There is a
simple experiment by which this power can be
shown.</p>

<p>Ex.&mdash;Take two barrels of pure beach sand,
and mix with the sand in one barrel a few handfuls
of charcoal dust, leaving that in the other pure.
Pour the brown liquor of the barn-yard through the
pure sand, and it will pass out at the bottom unaltered.
Pour the same liquor through the barrel,
containing the charcoal, and pure water will be obtained
as a result. The reason for this is that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
charcoal retains all of the impurities of the liquor,
and allows only the water to pass through. Charcoal
is often employed to purify water for drinking,
or for manufacturing purposes.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Will charcoal purify water?</p>

<p>If a piece of tainted meat, or a fishy duck be buried in a rich
garden soil, what takes place?</p>

<p>What is the reason of this?</p>

<p>How does charcoal overcome offensive odors?</p>

<p>How can you prove that charcoal absorbs the <i>mineral</i> impurities
of water?</p></div>

<p>A rich garden-soil contains large quantities of
carbonaceous matter; and, if we bury in such a soil
a piece of tainted meat or a fishy duck, it will, in a
short time, be deprived of its odor, because the
charcoal in the soil will entirely absorb it.</p>

<p>Carbon absorbs gases as well as the impurities of
water; and, if a little charcoal be sprinkled over
manure, or any other substance, emitting offensive
odors, the gases escaping will be taken up by the
charcoal, and the odor will cease.</p>

<p>It has also the power of absorbing <i>mineral</i>
matters, which are contained in water. If a quantity
of salt water be filtered through charcoal, the
salt will be retained, and the water will pass through
pure.</p>

<p>We are now able to see how carbon renders the
soil retentive of manures.</p>

<p>1st. Manures, which resemble the brown liquor
of barn-yards, have their fertilizing matters taken
out, and retained by it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>How does charcoal in the soil affect the manures applied?</p>

<p>Why does charcoal in the soil cause it to appropriate the gases
of the atmosphere?</p>

<p>What fertilizing gases exist in the atmosphere?</p>

<p>How are they carried to the soil?</p>

<p>Does the carbon retain them after they reach the soil?</p>

<p>What can you say of the air circulating through the soil?</p>

<p>How does carbon give the soil power to absorb moisture?</p></div>

<p>2d. The gases arising from the decomposition
(<i>rotting</i>) of manure are absorbed by it.</p>

<p>3d. The soluble mineral portions of manure,
which might in some soils leach down with water,
are arrested and retained at a point at which they
can be made use of by the roots of plants.</p>

<p>2. Charcoal in the soil causes it to appropriate
larger quantities of the fertilizing gases of the atmosphere,
on account of its power, as just named, to absorb
gases.</p>

<p>The atmosphere contains results, which have been
produced by the breathing of animals and by the decomposition
of various kinds of organic matter, which
are exposed to atmospheric influences. These gases
are chiefly ammonia and carbonic acid, both of which
are largely absorbed by water, and consequently are
contained in rain, snow, etc., which, as they enter
the soil, give up these gases to the charcoal, and
they there remain until required by plants. Even
the air itself, in circulating through the soil, gives up
fertilizing gases to the carbon, which it may contain.</p>

<p>3. Charcoal gives to the soil power to absorb
moisture, because it is itself one of the best ab<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>sorbents
in nature; and it has been proved by accurate
experiment that peaty soils absorb moisture
with greater rapidity, and part with it more slowly
than any other kind.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>How does it render it warmer?</p>

<p>Is the heat produced by the decomposition of organic matter
perceptible to our senses?</p>

<p>Is it so to the growing plant?</p>

<p>What is another important part of the organic matter in the
soil?</p></div>

<p>4. Carbon in the soil renders it warmer, because
it darkens its color. Black surfaces absorb more
heat than light ones, and a black coat, when worn
in the sun, is warmer than one of a lighter color.
By mixing carbon with the soil, we darken its color,
and render it capable of absorbing a greater amount
of heat from the sun's rays.</p>

<p>It will be recollected that, when vegetable matter
decomposes in the soil, it produces certain gases
(carbonic acid, etc.), which either escape into the
atmosphere, or are retained in the soil for the use of
plants. The production of these gases is always accompanied
by <i>heat</i>, which, though scarcely perceptible
to our senses, is perfectly so to the growing
plant, and is of much practical importance. This
will be examined more fully in speaking of manures.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>How is it obtained by the soil?</p>

<p>What offices does the organic matter in the soil perform?</p></div>

<p>Another important part of the organic matter in
the soil is that which contains <i>nitrogen</i>. This forms
but a very small portion of the soil, but it is of the
greatest importance to vegetables. As the nitrogen
in food is of absolute necessity to the growth of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
animals, so the nitrogen in the soil is indispensable
to the growth of cultivated plants. It is obtained
by the soil in the form of ammonia (or nitric acid),
from the atmosphere, or by the application of animal
matter. In some cases, manures called <i>nitrates</i><a name="FNanchor_S_19" id="FNanchor_S_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_S_19" class="fnanchor">[S]</a>
are used; and, in this manner, nitrogen is given to
the soil.</p>

<p>We have now learned that the organic matter in
the soil performs the following offices:&mdash;</p>

<p>Organic matter thoroughly decomposed is <i>carbon</i>,
and has the various effects ascribed to this substance
on p. 79.</p>

<p>Organic matter in process of decay produces carbonic
acid, and sometimes ammonia in the soil; also
its decay causes heat.</p>

<p>Organic matter containing <i>nitrogen</i>, such as
animal substances, etc., furnish ammonia, and other
nitrogenous substances to the roots of plants.</p>

<h3>USES OF INORGANIC MATTER.</h3>


<div class="sidenote"><p>What effect has clay besides the one already named?</p>

<p>How does it compare with charcoal for this purpose?</p></div>

<p>The offices performed by the inorganic constituents
of the soil are many and important.</p>

<p>These, as well as the different conditions in which
the bodies exist, are necessary to be thoroughly
studied.</p>

<p>Those parts which constitute the larger proportion
of the soil, namely the clay, sand, and limy
portions, are useful for purposes which have been
named in the first part of this section, while the <i>clay</i>
has an additional effect in the absorption of ammonia.</p>

<p>For this purpose, it is as effectual as charcoal,
the gases escaping from manures, as well as those
existing in the atmosphere, and in rain-water, being
arrested by clay as well as charcoal.<a name="FNanchor_T_20" id="FNanchor_T_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_T_20" class="fnanchor">[T]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>What particular condition of inorganic matter is requisite for
fertility?</p>

<p>What is the fixed rule with regard to this?</p>

<p>What is the condition of the alkalies in most of their combinations?
Of the acids?</p>

<p>What is said of phosphate of lime?</p></div>

<p>The more minute ingredients of the soil&mdash;those
which enter into the construction of plants&mdash;exist in
conditions which are more or less favorable or in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>jurious
to vegetable growth. The principal condition
necessary to fertility is <i>capacity to be dissolved</i>,
it being (so far as we have been able to ascertain) a
fixed rule, as was stated in the first section, that
<i>no mineral substance can enter into the roots of a
plant except it be dissolved in water</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>alkalies</i> potash, soda, lime, and magnesia,
are in nearly all of their combinations in the soil
sufficiently soluble for the purposes of growth.</p>

<p>The <i>acids</i> are, as will be recollected, sulphuric
and phosphoric. These exist in the soil in combination
with the alkalies, as sulphates and phosphates,
which are more or less soluble under natural circumstances.
Phosphoric acid in combination with lime
as phosphate of lime is but slightly soluble; but,
when it exists in the compound known as <i>super</i>-phosphate
of lime, it is much more soluble, and consequently
enters into the composition of plants with
much greater facility. This matter will be more
fully explained in the section on manures.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>How may silica be rendered soluble?</p>

<p>What is the condition of chlorine in the soil?</p>

<p>Do peroxide and protoxide of iron affect plants in the same way?</p>

<p>How would you treat a soil containing protoxide of iron?</p>

<p>On what does the usefulness of all these matters in the soil
depend?</p></div>

<p>The <i>neutrals</i>, silica, chlorine, oxide of iron, and
oxide of manganese, deserve a careful examination.
Silica exists in the soil usually in the form of <i>sand,</i>
in which it is, as is well known, perfectly insoluble;
and, before it can be used by plants, which often re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>quire
it in large quantities, it must be made soluble,
which is done by combining it with an alkali.</p>

<p>For instance, if the silica in the soil is insoluble,
we must make an application of an alkali, such as
potash, which will unite with the silica, and form
the silicate of potash, which is in the exact condition
to be dissolved and carried into the roots of plants.</p>

<p>Chlorine in the soil is probably always in an
available condition.</p>

<p>Oxide of iron exists, as has been previously
stated, usually in the form of the <i>per</i>oxide (or red
oxide). Sometimes, however, it exists in the form
of the <i>prot</i>oxide (or black oxide), which is poisonous
to plants, and renders the soil unfertile. By loosening
the soil in such a manner as to admit air and water,
this compound takes up more oxygen, which renders
it a peroxide, and makes it available for plants. The
oxide of manganese is probably of little consequence.</p>

<p>The usefulness of all of these matters in the soil
depends on their <i>exposure</i>; if they are in the <i>interior</i>
of particles, they cannot be made use of; while, if
the particles are so pulverized that their constituents
are exposed, they become available, because water
can immediately attack to dissolve, and carry them
into roots.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>What is one of the chief offices of plowing and hoeing?</p>

<p>Is the subsoil usually different from the surface soil?</p>

<p>What circumstances have occasioned the difference?
In what way?</p></div>

<p>This is one of the great offices of plowing and
hoeing; the <i>lumps</i> of soil being thereby more broken
up and exposed to the action of atmospheric influences,
which are often necessary to produce a fertile
condition of soil, while the trituration of particles
reduces them in size.</p>


<h3 class="gap2">SUBSOIL.</h3>

<div class="sidenote"><p>May the subsoil be made to resemble the surface soil?</p>

<p>May all soils be brought to the highest state of fertility?</p>

<p>On what examination must improvement be based?</p>

<p>What is the difference between the soil of some parts of
Massachusetts and that of the Miami valley?</p></div>

<p>The subsoil is usually of a different character from
the surface soil, but this difference is more often the
result of circumstances than of formation. The
surface soil from having been long cultivated has
been more opened to the influences of the air than is
the case with the subsoil, which has never been disturbed
so as to allow the same action. Again the
growth of plants has supplied the surface soil with
roots, which by decaying have given it organic matter,
thus darkening its color, rendering it warmer,
and giving greater ability to absorb heat and
moisture, and to retain manures. All of these effects
render the surface soil of a more fertile character
than it was before vegetable growth commenced;
and, where frequent cultivation and manures have
been applied, a still greater benefit has resulted. In
most instances the subsoil may by the same means<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
be gradually improved in condition until it equals
the surface soil in fertility. The means of producing
this result, also farther accounts of its advantages,
will be given under the head of <i>Cultivation</i> <a href="#SECTION_FOURTH">(Sect. IV.)</a></p>


<h3 class="gap4">IMPROVEMENT.</h3>

<p>From what has now been said of the character of
the soil, it must be evident that, as we know the
<i>causes</i> of fertility and barrenness, we may by the proper
means improve the character of all soils which
are not now in the highest state of fertility.</p>

<p>Chemical analysis will tell us the <i>composition</i>
of a soil, and an examination, such as any farmer
may make, will inform us of its deficiencies in <i>mechanical</i>
character, and we may at once resort to the
proper means to secure fertility. In some instances
the soil may contain every thing that is required,
but not in the necessary condition. For instance, in
some parts of Massachusetts, there are nearly <i>barren</i>
soils which show by analysis precisely the same
chemical composition as the soil of the Miami valley
of Ohio, one of the most <i>fertile</i> in the world. The
cause of this great difference in their agricultural
capabilities, is that the Miami soil has its particles<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
finely pulverized; while in the Massachusetts soil the
ingredients are combined within particles (such as
pebbles, etc.), where they are out of the reach of roots.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Why do soils of the same degree of fineness sometimes differ
in fertility?</p>

<p>Can soils always be rendered fertile with profit?</p>

<p>Can we determine the cost before commencing the work?</p>

<p>What must be done before a soil can be cultivated understandingly?</p>

<p>What must be done to keep up the quality of the soil?</p></div>

<p>In other cases, we find two soils, which are equally
well pulverized, and which appear to be of the
same character, having very different power to support
crops. Chemical analysis will show in these
instances a difference of composition.</p>

<p>All of these differences may be overcome by the
use of the proper means. Sometimes it could be
done at an expense which would be justified by the
result; and, at others, it might require too large an
outlay to be profitable. It becomes a question of
economy, not of ability, and science is able to estimate
the cost.</p>

<p>Soil cannot be cultivated understandingly until
it has been subjected to such an examination as
will tell us exactly what is necessary to render it
fertile. Even after fertility is perfectly restored
it requires thought and care to maintain it. The
ingredients of the soil must be returned in the form
of manures as largely as they are removed by the
crop, or the supply will eventually become too small
for the purposes of vegetation.</p>

<h2>MANURES.</h2>

<h3>CHARACTER AND VARIETIES OF MANURES.</h3>


<div class="sidenote"><p>What must a farmer know in order to avoid failures?</p>

<p>Can this be learned entirely from observation?</p>

<p>What kind of action have manures?</p>

<p>Give examples of each of these.</p>

<p>May mechanical effects be produced by chemical action?</p>

<p>How does potash affect the soil?</p></div>

<p>To understand the science of <i>manures</i> is the most
important branch of practical farming. No baker
would be called a good practical baker who kept his
flour exposed to the sun and rain. No shoemaker
would be called a good practical shoemaker, who used
morocco for the soles of his shoes, and heavy leather
for the uppers. No carpenter would be called a good
practical carpenter, who tried to build a house without
nails, or other fastenings. So with the farmer. He
cannot be called a good practical farmer if he keeps
the materials, from which he is to make plants, in
such a condition, that they will have their value<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
destroyed, uses them in the wrong places, or tries to
put them together without having every thing present
that is necessary. Before he can avoid failures
<i>with certainty</i>, he must know what manures are composed
of, how they are to be preserved, where they are
needed, and what kinds are required. True, he may
from observation and experience, <i>guess</i> at results, but
he cannot <i>know</i> that he is right until he has learned
the facts above named. In this section of our work,
we mean to convey some of the information necessary
to this branch of <i>practical farming</i>.</p>

<p>We shall adopt a classification of the subject
somewhat different from that found in most works
on manures, but the <i>facts</i> are the same. The action
of manures is either <i>mechanical</i> or <i>chemical</i>,
or a combination of both. For instance: some
kinds of manure improve the mechanical character
of the soil, such as those which loosen stiff clay soils,
or others which render light sandy soils compact&mdash;these
are called <i>mechanical</i> manures. Some again
furnish food for plants&mdash;these are called <i>chemical</i>
manures.</p>

<p>Many mechanical manures produce their effects
by means of chemical action. Thus <i>potash</i> combines
chemically with sand in the soil. In so doing, it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
roughens the surfaces of the particles of sand, and
renders the soil less liable to be compacted by rains.
In this manner, it acts as a <i>mechanical</i> manure.
The compound of sand and potash,<a name="FNanchor_U_21" id="FNanchor_U_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_U_21" class="fnanchor">[U]</a> as well as the
potash alone, may enter into the composition of
plants, and hence it is a <i>chemical</i> manure. In other
words, potash belongs to both classes described above.</p>

<p>It is important that this distinction should be
well understood by the learner, as the words "mechanical"
and "chemical" in connection with manures will
be made use of throughout the following pages.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>What are absorbents?</p>

<p>What kind of manure is charcoal?</p></div>

<p>There is another class of manures which we shall
call <i>absorbents</i>. These comprise those substances
which have the power of taking up fertilizing matters,
and retaining them for the use of plants. For
instance, <i>charcoal</i> is an absorbent. As was stated
in the section on soils, this substance is a retainer
of all fertilizing gases and many minerals. Other
matters made use of in agriculture have the same
effect. These absorbents will be spoken of more
fully in their proper places.</p>

<h3>EXCREMENTS OF ANIMALS.</h3>


<div class="sidenote"><p>Of what is animal excrement composed?</p>

<p>Explain the composition of the food of animals.</p>

<p>What does hay contain?</p>

<p>To what does Liebig compare the consumption of food by animals,
and why?</p></div>

<p>The first organic manure which we shall examine, is
animal <i>excrement</i>.</p>

<p>This is composed of those matters which have
been eaten by the animal as food, and have been
thrown off as solid or liquid manure. In order that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
we may know of what they consist, we must refer to
the composition of food and examine the process of
digestion.</p>

<p>The food of animals, we have seen to consist of
both organic and inorganic matter. The organic
part may be divided into two classes, <i>i. e.</i>, that portion
which contains nitrogen&mdash;such as gluten, albumen,
etc., and that which does not contain nitrogen&mdash;such
as starch, sugar, oil, etc.</p>

<p>The inorganic part of food may also be divided into
<i>soluble</i> matter and <i>insoluble</i> matter.</p>


<h3 class="gap2">DIGESTION AND ITS PRODUCTS.</h3>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Of what does that part of dung consist which resembles soot?</p>

<p>What else does the dung contain?</p>

<p>In what manner does the digested part of food escape from the
body?</p></div>

<p>Let us now suppose that we have a full-grown ox,
which is not increasing in any of his parts, but only
consumes food to keep up his respiration, and to supply
the natural wastes of his body. To this ox we
will feed a ton of hay which contains organic matter,
with and without nitrogen, and soluble and insoluble
inorganic substances. Now let us try to follow it
through its changes in the animal, and observe its
destination. Liebig compares the consumption of
food by animals to the imperfect burning of wood in
a stove, where a portion of the fuel is resolved into
gases and ashes (that is, it is completely burned), and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
another portion, which is not thoroughly burned,
passes off as <i>soot</i>. In the animal action in question,
the food undergoes changes which are similar to this
burning of wood. A part of the food is <i>digested</i> and
taken up by the blood, while another portion remains
undigested, and passes the bowels as solid dung&mdash;corresponding
to soot. This part of the dung then,
we see is merely so much of the food as passes through
the system without being materially changed. Its
nature is easily understood. It contains organic and
inorganic matter in nearly the same condition as they
existed in the hay. They have been rendered finer
and softer, but their chemical character is not materially
altered. The dung also contains small
quantities of nitrogenous matter, which <i>leaked out</i>,
as it were, from the stomach and intestines. The
digested food, however, undergoes further changes
which affect its character, and it escapes from the
body in three ways&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>, through the lungs, through
the bladder, and through the bowels. It will be recollected
from the first section of this book, p. 22,
that the carbon in the blood of animals, unites with
the oxygen of the air drawn into the lungs, and is
thrown off in the breath as carbonic acid. The hydrogen
and oxygen unite to form a part of the water
which constitutes the moisture of the breath.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Explain the escape of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen.</p>

<p>What becomes of the nitrogenous parts?</p>

<p>How is the <i>soluble</i> ash of the digested food parted with?</p>

<p>The insoluble?</p>

<p>If any portions of the food are not returned in the dung, how
are they disposed of?</p></div>

<p>That portion of the organic part of the hay which
has been taken up by the blood of the ox, and which
does not contain nitrogen (corresponding to the <i>first</i>
class of proximates, as described in <a href="#SECTION_FIRST">Sect. I</a>), is emitted
through the lungs. It consists, as will be recollected,
of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, and these assume,
in respiration, the form of carbonic acid and
water.</p>

<p>The organic matter of the digested hay, in the
blood, which contains nitrogen (corresponding to the
<i>second</i> class of proximates, described in <a href="#SECTION_FIRST">Sect. I</a>), goes
to the <i>bladder</i>, where it assumes the form of urea&mdash;a
constituent of urine or liquid manure.</p>

<p>We have now disposed of the imperfectly digested
food (dung), and of the <i>organic</i> matter which
was taken up by the blood. All that remains to be
examined is the inorganic or mineral matter in the
blood, which would have become <i>ashes</i>, if the hay
had been burned. The <i>soluble</i> part of this inorganic
matter passes into the bladder, and forms the <i>inorganic
part of urine</i>. The <i>insoluble</i> part passes the
bowels, in connection with the dung.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>How is their place supplied?</p>

<p>Is food put out of existence when it is fed to animals?</p>

<p>What does the solid dung contain? Liquid manure? The
breath?</p></div>

<p>If any of the food taken up by the blood is not
returned as above stated, it goes to form fat, muscle,
hair, bones, or some other part of the animal, and as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
he is not growing (not increasing in weight) an
equivalent amount of the body of the animal goes to
the manure to take the place of the part retained.<a name="FNanchor_V_22" id="FNanchor_V_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_V_22" class="fnanchor">[V]</a></p>

<p>We now have our subject in a form to be readily
understood. We learn that when food is given to
animals it is not <i>put out of existence</i>, but is merely
<i>changed in form</i>; and that in the impurities of the
breath, we have a large portion of those parts
of the food which plants obtain from air and from
water; while the solid and liquid excrements contain
all that was taken by the plants from the soil and
manures.</p>

<p class="hangspecial">The <span class="smcap">Solid Dung</span> contains the undigested parts of the food, the

<h3>WASTE OF MANURE.</h3>


<div class="sidenote"><p>What are the first causes of loss of manure?</p>

<p>What is <i>evaporation</i>?</p></div>

<p>The loss of manure is a subject which demands most
serious attention. Until within a few years, little
was known about the true character of manures, and
consequently, of the importance of protecting them
against loss.</p>

<p>The first causes of waste are <i>evaporation</i> and
<i>leaching</i>.</p>


<h3 class="gap2">EVAPORATION.</h3>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Name a solid body which evaporates.</p>

<p>What takes place when a dead animal is exposed to the atmosphere
for a sufficient time?</p>

<p>What often assist the evaporation of solids?</p></div>

<p>Evaporation is the changing of a solid or liquid
body to a vapory form. Thus common smelling salts,
a solid, if left exposed, passes into the atmosphere in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
the form of a gas or vapor. Water, a liquid, evaporates,
and becomes a vapor in the atmosphere.
This is the case with very many substances, and in organic
nature, both solid and liquid, they are liable
to assume a gaseous form, and become mixed with
the atmosphere. They are not destroyed, but are
merely changed in form.</p>

<p>As an instance of this action, suppose an animal
to die and to decay on the surface of the earth.
After a time, the flesh will entirely disappear, but is
not lost. It no longer exists as the flesh of an animal,
but its carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen,
still exist in the air. They have been liberated from
the attractions which held them together, and have
passed away; but (as we already know from what
has been said in a former section) they are ready to
be again taken up by plants, and pressed into the service
of life.</p>

<p>The evaporation of liquids may take place without
the aid of any thing but heat; still, in the case of
solids, it is often assisted by decay and combustion,
which break up the bonds that hold the constituents
of bodies together, and thus enable them to return
to the atmosphere, from which they were originally
derived.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>What is the cause of odor?</p>

<p>When we perceive an odor, what is taking place?</p>

<p>Why do manures give off offensive odors?</p>

<p>How may we detect ammonia escaping from manure?</p></div>

<p>It must be recollected that every thing, which has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
an <i>odor</i> (or can be smelled), is evaporating. The
odor is caused by parts of the body floating in the
air, and acting on the nerves of the nose. This is
an invariable rule; and, when we perceive an odor,
we may be sure that parts of the material, from which
it emanates, are escaping. If we perceive the odor
of an apple, it is because parts of the volatile oils of
the apple enter the nose. The same is true when we
smell hartshorn, cologne, etc.</p>

<p>Manures made by animals have an offensive odor,
simply because volatile parts of the manure escape
into the air, and are therefore made perceptible. All
organic parts in turn become volatile, assuming a
gaseous form as they decompose.</p>

<p>We do not see the gases rising, but there are
many ways by which we can detect them. If we
wave a feather over a manure heap, from which
ammonia is escaping, the feather having been recently
dipped in manure, white fumes will appear around
the feather, being the muriate of ammonia formed by
the union of the escaping gas with the muriatic acid.
Not only ammonia, but also carbonic acid, and other
gases which are useful to vegetation escape, and are
given to the winds. Indeed it may be stated in few
words that all of the organic part of <i>plants</i> (all that
was obtained from the air, water, and ammonia),<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
constituting more than nine tenths of their dry
weight, may be evaporated by the assistance of decay
or combustion. The organic part of <i>manures</i> may
be lost in the same manner; and, if the process of
decomposition be continued long enough, nothing
but a mass of mineral matter will remain, except
perhaps a small quantity of carbon which has not
been resolved into carbonic acid.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>What remains after manure has been long exposed to decomposition?</p>

<p>What gaseous compounds are formed by the decomposition of
manures?</p></div>

<p>The proportion of solid manure lost by evaporation
(made by the assistance of decay), is a very
large part of the whole. Manure cannot be kept a
single day in its natural state without losing something.
It commences to give out an offensive odor
immediately, and this odor is occasioned, as was
before stated, by the loss of some of its fertilizing
parts.</p>

<p>Animal manure contains, as will be seen by reference
to p. <a href="#Page_100">100</a>, all of the substances contained
in plants, though not always in the correct relative
proportions to each other. When decomposition
commences, the carbon unites with the
oxygen of the air, and passes off as carbonic acid;
the hydrogen and oxygen combine to form water
(which evaporates), and the <i>nitrogen is mostly resolved
into ammonia, which escapes into the atmosphere</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Describe fire-fanging.</p>

<p>What takes place when animal manure is exposed in an open
barn-yard?</p>

<p>What does liquid manure lose by evaporation?</p></div>

<p>If manure is thrown into heaps, it often ferments
so rapidly as to produce sufficient heat to set
fire to some parts of the manure, and cause it to be
thrown off with greater rapidity. This may be observed
in nearly all heaps of animal excrement. When
they have lain for some time in mild weather, gray
streaks of <i>ashes</i> are often to be seen in the centre of
the pile. The organic part of the manure having
been <i>burned</i> away, nothing but the ash remains,&mdash;this
is called <i>fire-fanging</i>.</p>

<p>Manures kept in cellars without being mixed
with refuse matter are subject to the same losses.</p>

<p>When kept in the yard, they are still liable to be
lost by evaporation. They are here often saturated
with water, and this water in its evaporation carries
away the ammonia, and carbonic acid which it has
obtained from the rotting mass. The evaporation of
the water is rapidly carried on, on account of the
great extent of surface. The whole mass is spongy,
and soaks the liquids up from below (through hollow
straws, etc.), to be evaporated at the surface on
the same principle as causes the wick of a lamp
to draw up the oil to supply fuel for the flame.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Liquid Manure</span> containing large quantities of
nitrogen, and forming much ammonia, is also liable
to lose all of its organic part from evaporation (and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
fermentation), so that it is rendered as much less
valuable as is the solid dung.<a name="FNanchor_X_24" id="FNanchor_X_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_X_24" class="fnanchor">[X]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>When does the waste of exposed manure commence?</p>

<p>What does economy of manure require?</p>

<p>What is the effect of leaching?</p>

<p>Give an illustration of leaching.</p></div>

<p>From these remarks, it may be justly inferred that a
very large portion of the <i>value</i> of solid and liquid
manure as ordinarily kept is lost by evaporation in a
sufficient length of time, depending on circumstances,
whether it be three months or several years. The
wasting commences as soon as the manure is dropped,
and continues, except in very cold weather, until
the destruction is complete. Hence we see that true
economy requires that the manures of the stable,
stye, and poultry-house, should be protected from
evaporation (as will be hereafter described), as soon
as possible after they are made.</p>


<h3 class="gap2">LEACHING.</h3>

<p>The subject of <i>leaching</i> is as important in considering
the <i>inorganic</i> parts of manures as evaporation
is to the organic, while leaching also affects the
organic gases, they being absorbed by water in a great
degree.</p>

<p>A good illustration of leaching is found in the
manufacture of potash. When water is poured<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
over wood-ashes, it dissolves their potash which it carries
through in solution, making ley. If ley is boiled
to dryness, it leaves the potash in a solid form, proving
that this substance had been dissolved by the water
and removed from the insoluble parts of the ashes.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>How does water affect decomposing manures?</p>

<p>Does continued decomposition continue to prepare material to
be leached away?</p>

<p>How far from the surface of the soil may organic constituents
be carried by water?</p></div>

<p>In the same way water in passing through manures
takes up the soluble portions of the ash as fast
as liberated by decomposition, and carries them into
the soil below; or, if the water runs off from the
surface, they accompany it. In either case they are
lost to the manure. There is but a small quantity
of ash exposed for leaching in recent manures; but,
as the decomposition of the organic part proceeds, it
continues to develope it more and more (in the same
manner as burning would do, only slower), thus preparing
fresh supplies to be carried off with each
shower. In this way, while manures are largely injured
by evaporation, the soluble inorganic parts are
removed by water until but a small remnant of its
original fertilizing properties remains.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>What arrests their farther progress?</p>

<p>What would be the effect of allowing these matters to filter
downwards?</p>

<p>What does evaporation remove from manure? Leaching?</p></div>

<p>It is a singular fact concerning leaching, that
water is able to carry no part of the organic constituents
of vegetables more than about thirty-four
inches below the surface in a fertile soil. They
would probably be carried to an unlimited distance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
in pure sand, as it contains nothing which is capable
of arresting them; but, in most soils, the clay and
carbon which they contain retain all of the ammonia;
also nearly all of the matters which go to form the inorganic
constituents of plants within about the above
named distance from the surface of the soil. If such
were not the case, the fertility of the earth must soon
be destroyed, as all of those elements which the soil
must supply to growing plants would be carried down
out of the reach of roots, and leave the world a
barren waste, its surface having lost its elements of
fertility, while the downward filtration of these
would render the water of wells unfit for our use.
Now, however, they are all retained near the surface
of the soil, and the water issues from springs comparatively
pure.</p>

<h3>ABSORBENTS.</h3>


<div class="sidenote"><p>What substances are called absorbents?</p>

<p>What is the most important of these?</p>

<p>What substances are called charcoal in agriculture?</p>

<p>How is vegetable matter rendered useful as charcoal?</p></div>

<p>Before considering farther the subject of animal
excrement, it is necessary to examine a class of
manures known as <i>absorbents</i>. These comprise all
matters which have the power of absorbing, or soaking
up, as it were, the gases which arise from the
evaporation of solid and liquid manures, and retaining
them until required by plants.</p>

<p>The most important of these is undoubtedly <i>carbon</i>
or charcoal.</p>


<h3 class="gap4">CHARCOAL.</h3>

<p><i>Charcoal</i>, in an agricultural sense, means all
forms of carbon, whether as peat, muck, charcoal
dust from the spark-catchers of locomotives, charcoal
hearths, river and swamp deposits, leaf mould, decomposed
spent tanbark or sawdust, etc. In short,
if any vegetable matter is decomposed with the partial
exclusion of air (so that there shall not be oxygen
enough supplied to unite with all of the carbon), a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
portion of its carbon remains in the exact condition
to serve the purposes of charcoal.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>What is the first-named effect of charcoal? The second?
Third? Fourth?</p>

<p>Explain the first action.</p></div>

<p>The offices performed in the soil by carbonaceous
matter were fully explained in a former section (p. <a href="#Page_79">79</a>,
Sect. 2), and we will now examine merely its action
with regard to manures. When properly applied to
manures, in compost, it has the following effects:</p>

<p>1. It absorbs and retains the fertilizing gases
evaporating from decomposing matters.</p>

<p>2. It acts as a <i>divisor</i>, thereby reducing the
strength (or intensity) of powerful manures&mdash;thus
rendering them less likely to injure the roots of
plants; and also increases their bulk, so as to prevent
<i>fire fanging</i> in composts.</p>

<p>3. It in part prevents the leaching out of the
soluble parts of the ash.</p>

<p>4. It keeps the compost moist.</p>

<p>The first-named office of charcoal, <i>i. e.</i>, absorbing
and retaining gases, is one of the utmost importance.
It is this quality that gives to it so high a position
in the opinion of all who have used it. As was
stated in the section on soils, carbonaceous matter
seems to be capable of absorbing every thing which
may be of use to vegetation. It is a grand purifier,
and while it prevents offensive odors from escaping,
it is at the same time storing its pores with
food for the nourishment of plants.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Explain its action as a divisor.</p>

<p>How does charcoal protect composts against injurious action of
rains?</p>

<p>How does it keep them moist?</p></div>

<p>2d. In its capacity as a <i>divisor</i> for manures, charcoal
should be considered as excellent in all cases,
especially to use with strongly concentrated (or heating)
animal manures. These, when applied in their
natural state to the soil, are very apt to injure young
roots by the violence of their action. When mixed
with a divisor, such manures are <i>diluted</i>, made less
active, and consequently less injurious. In composts,
manures are liable, as has been before stated, to become
burned by the resultant heat of decomposition;
this is called <i>fire fanging</i>, and is prevented by the
liberal use of divisors, because, by increasing the
bulk, the heat being diffused through a larger mass,
becomes less intense. The same principle is exhibited
in the fact that it takes more fire to boil a
cauldron of water than a tea-kettle full.</p>

<p>3d. Charcoal has much power to arrest the passage
of mineral matters in solution; so much so, that
compost heaps, well supplied with muck, are less affected
by rains than those not so supplied. All
composts, however, should be kept under cover.</p>

<p>4th. Charcoal keeps the compost moist from the
ease with which it absorbs water, and its ability to
withstand drought.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>What source of carbon is within the reach of most farmers?</p>

<p>What do we mean by muck?</p>

<p>Of what does it consist?</p>

<p>How does it differ in quality?</p></div>

<p>With these advantages before us, we must see
the importance of an understanding of the modes for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
obtaining charcoal. Many farmers are so situated
that they can obtain sufficient quantities of charcoal
dust. Others have not equal facilities. Nearly all,
however, can obtain <i>muck</i>, and to this we will now
turn our attention.</p>


<h3 class="gap2">MUCK, AND THE LIME AND SALT MIXTURE.</h3>

<div class="sidenote"><p>What is the first step in preparing muck for decomposition?</p>

<p>With what proportion of the lime and salt mixture should it
be composted?</p>

<p>Why should this compost be made under cover?</p>

<p>What is this called after decomposition?</p>

<p>Why should we not use muck immediately after taking it from
the swamp?</p></div>

<p>By <i>muck</i>, we mean the vegetable deposits of
swamps and rivers. It consists of decayed organic
substances, mixed with more or less earth. Its principal
constituent is <i>carbon</i>, in different degrees of
development, which has remained after the decomposition
of vegetable matter. Muck varies largely
in its quality, according to the amount of carbon
which it contains, and the perfection of its decomposition.
The best muck is usually found in comparatively
dry locations, where the water which once
caused the deposit has been removed. Muck which
has been long in this condition, is usually better decomposed
than that which is saturated with water.
The muck from swamps, however, may soon be
brought to the best condition. It should be thrown
out, if possible, at least one year before it is required
for use (a less time may suffice, except in very cold<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
climates) and left, in small heaps or ridges, to the
action of the weather, which will assist in pulverizing
it, while, from having its water removed, its decomposition
goes on more rapidly.</p>

<p>After the muck has remained in this condition
a sufficient length of time, it may be removed to the
barn-yard and composted with the lime and salt mixture
(described on page <a href="#Page_115">115</a>) in the proportion of one
cord of muck to four bushels of the mixture. This
compost ought to be made under cover, lest the rain
leach out the constituents of the mixture, and thus
occasion loss; at the end of a month or more, the
muck in the compost will have been reduced to a fine
pulverulent mass, nearly equal to charcoal dust for
application to animal excrement. When in this
condition it is called <i>prepared</i> muck, by which name
it will be designated in the following pages.</p>

<p>Muck should not be used immediately after being
taken from the swamp, as it is then almost always
<i>sour</i>, and is liable to produce sorrel. Its <i>sourness</i> is
due to <i>acids</i> which it contains, and these must be
rectified by the application of an alkali, or by long
exposure to the weather, before the muck is suitable
for use.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>


<h3 class="gap2">LIME AND SALT MIXTURE.</h3>

<div class="sidenote"><p>What proportions of lime and salt are required for the decomposing
mixture?</p>

<p>Explain the process of making it.</p>

<p>Why should it be made under cover?</p></div>

<p>The lime and salt mixture, used in the decomposition
of muck, is made in the following manner:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Recipe.</span>&mdash;Take <i>three</i> bushels of shell lime, <i>hot
from the kiln</i>, or as fresh as possible, and slake it
with water in which <i>one</i> bushel of salt has been dissolved.</p>

<p>Care must be taken to use only so much water as
is necessary to dissolve the salt, as it is difficult to
induce the lime to absorb a larger quantity.</p>

<p>In dissolving the salt, it is well to hang it in a
basket in the upper part of the water, as the salt
water will immediately settle towards the bottom
(being heavier), and allow the freshest water to be
nearest to the salt. In this way, the salt may be all
dissolved, and thus make the brine used to slake the
lime. It may be necessary to apply the brine at intervals
of a day or two, and to stir the mass often,
as the amount of water is too great to be readily
absorbed.</p>

<p>This mixture should be made under cover, as, if
exposed, it would obtain moisture from rain or dew,
which would prevent the use of all the brine.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
Another objection to its exposure to the weather is
its great liability to be washed away by rains. It
should be at least ten days old before being used,
and would probably be improved by an age of three
or four months, as the chemical changes it undergoes
will require some time to be completed.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Explain the character of this mixture as represented in the

by the following diagram:&mdash;</p>

<p>On what does the energy of this effect depend?</p>

<p>Why should a compost of muck and lime be protected from

<p>Muck may be decomposed by the aid of other materials.
<i>Lime</i> is very efficient, though not as much
so as when combined with salt. The action of lime,
when applied to the muck, depends very much on its
condition. Air-slaked lime (carbonate of lime),
and hydrate of lime, slaked with water, have but a
limited effect compared with lime freshly burned
and applied in a caustic (or pure) form. When so
used, however, the compost should not be exposed to
rains, as this would have a tendency to make <i>mortar</i>
which would harden it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>From what sources may potash be obtained?</p>

<p><i>Potash</i> is a very active agent in decomposing
vegetable matter, and may be used with great advantage,
especially where an analysis of the soil which
is to be manured shows a deficiency of potash.</p>

<p><i>Unleached</i> wood ashes are generally the best

twenty-five bushels of these mixed with one cord of
muck will produce the desired result.<a name="FNanchor_Z_26" id="FNanchor_Z_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_Z_26" class="fnanchor">[Z]</a></p>

<p>The sparlings (or refuse) of potash warehouses
may often be purchased at sufficiently low rates to be

They may be applied at the rate of from twenty to
one hundred pounds to each cord of muck.</p>

<h3>COMPOSTING STABLE MANURE.</h3>


<div class="sidenote"><p>What principles should regulate us in composting?</p>

<p>In what condition is solid dung of value as a fertilizer?</p>

<p>What do we aim to do in composting?</p></div>

<p>In composting stable manure in the most economical
manner, the evaporation of the organic parts and
the leaching of the ashy (and other) portions must
be avoided, while the condition of the mass is such as
to admit of the perfect decomposition of the manure.</p>

<p>Solid manures in their fresh state are of but very
little use to plants. It is only as they are decomposed,
and have their nitrogen turned into ammonia,
and their other ingredients resolved into the condition
required by plants, that they are of much value
as fertilizers. We have seen that, if this decomposition
takes place without proper precautions being
made, the most valuable parts of the manure would
be lost. Nor would it be prudent to keep manures
from decomposing until they are applied to the soil,
for then they are not immediately ready for use, and
time is lost. By composting, we aim to save every
thing while we prepare the manures for immediate
use.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>


<h3 class="gap2">SHELTER.</h3>

<div class="sidenote"><p>What is the first consideration for composts?</p>

<p>Describe the arrangement of floor.</p></div>

<p>The first consideration in preparing for composting,
is to provide proper shelter. This may be done
either by means of a shed or by arranging a cellar
under the stables, or in any other manner that may
be dictated by circumstances. It is no doubt better
to have the manure shed enclosed so as to make it
an effectual protection; this however is not absolutely
necessary if the roof project far enough over
the compost to shelter it from the sun's rays and from
driving rains.</p>

<p>The importance of some protection of this kind,
is evident from what has already been said, and
indeed it is impossible to make an economical use of
manures without it. The trifling cost of building a
shed, or preparing a cellar, is amply repaid in the
benefit resulting from their uses.</p>


<h3 class="gap2">THE FLOOR.</h3>

<p>The <i>floor</i> or foundation on which to build the
compost deserves some consideration. It may be of
plank tightly fitted, a hard bed of clay, or better, a
cemented surface. Whatever material is used in its
construction (and stiff clay mixed with water and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
beaten compactly down answers an excellent purpose),
the floor must have such an inclination as will cause
it to discharge water only at one point. That is,
one part of the edge must be lower than the rest of
the floor, which must be so shaped that water will
run towards this point from every part of it; then&mdash;the
floor being water-tight&mdash;all of the liquids of the
compost may be collected in a</p>


<h3 class="gap2">TANK.</h3>

<div class="sidenote"><p>How should the tank be attached?</p></div>

<p>This <i>tank</i> used to collect the liquids of the manure
may be made by sinking a barrel or hogshead
(according to the size of the heap) in the ground at
the point where it is required, or in any other convenient
manner.</p>

<p>In the tank a pump of cheap construction may
be placed, to raise the liquid to a sufficient height to
be conveyed by a trough to the centre of the heap,
and there distributed by means of a perforated board
with raised edges, and long enough to reach across the
heap in any direction. By altering the position of
this board, the liquid may be carried evenly over
the whole mass.</p>

<p>The appearance of the apparatus required for composting,
and the compost laid up, may be better
shown by the following figure.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 591px;">
<img src="images/fig002.png" width="591" height="547" alt="Fig. 2. a, tank; b, pump; c &amp; g, perforated board; d, muck;

<span class="caption">Fig. 2.<br />
<br />
a, tank; b, pump; c &amp; g, perforated board; d, muck;
e, manure; f, floor.</span>
</div>

<div class="sidenote"><p>How is the compost made?</p></div>

<p>The compost is made by laying on the floor ten
or twelve inches of muck, and on that a few inches
of manure, then another heavy layer of muck, and
another of manure, continuing in this manner until
the heap is raised to the required height, always having
a thick layer of muck at the top.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>What liquids are best for moistening the compost?</p>

<p>How should they be applied?</p>

<p>What are the advantages of this moistening?</p>

<p>How does it compare with forking over?</p></div>

<p>After laying up the heap, the tank should be
filled with liquid manure from the stables, slops from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
the house, soap-suds, or other water containing fertilizing
matter, to be pumped over the mass. There
should be enough of the liquid to saturate the heap
and filter through to fill the tank twice a week, at
which intervals it should be again pumped up, thus
continually being passed through the manure. This
liquid should not be changed, as it contains much
soluble manure. Should the liquid manures named
above not be sufficient, the quantity may be increased
by the use of rain-water. That falling
during the first ten minutes of a shower is the best,
as it contains much ammonia.</p>

<p>The effects produced by frequently watering the
compost is one of the greatest advantages of this
system.</p>

<p>The soluble portions of the manure are equally
diffused through every part of the heap.</p>

<p>Should the heat of fermentation be too great, the
watering will reduce it.</p>

<p>When the compost is saturated with water, the
air is driven out; and, as the water subsides, <i>fresh</i>
air enters and takes its place. This fresh air contains
oxygen, which assists in the decomposition of
the manure.</p>

<p>In short, the watering does all the work of forking
over by hand much better and much more cheaply.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Why will the ammonia of manure thus made, not escape if it
be used as a top dressing?</p>

<p>What are the advantages of preparing manures in this manner?</p>

<p>What is the profit attending it?</p></div>

<p>At the end of a month or more, this compost will
be ready for use. The layers in the manure will
have disappeared, the whole mass having become
of a uniform character, highly fertilizing, and ready
to be immediately used by plants.</p>

<p>It may be applied to the soil, either as a top-dressing,
or otherwise, without fear of loss, as the
muck will retain all of the gases which would
otherwise evaporate.</p>

<p>The cost and trouble of the foregoing system of
composting are trifling compared with its advantages.
The quantity of the manure is much increased, and
its quality improved. The health of the animals is
secured by the retention of those gases, which, when
allowed to escape, render impure the air which they
have to breathe.</p>

<p>The cleanliness of the stable and yard is much
advanced as the effete matters, which would otherwise
litter them, are carefully removed to the compost.</p>

<p>As an instance of the profit of composting, it may
be stated that Prof. Mapes has decomposed ninety-two
cords of swamp muck, with four hundred bushels
of the lime and salt mixture, and then composted
it with eight cords of <i>fresh</i> horse dung, making one
hundred cords of manure fully equal to the same
amount of stable-manure alone, which has lain one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
year exposed to the weather. Indeed one cord of
muck well decomposed, and containing the chlorine
lime and soda of four bushels of the mixture, is of itself
equal in value to the same amount of manure which
has lain in an open barn-yard during the heat and
rain of one season, and is then applied to the land
in a <i>raw</i> or undecomposed state.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>In what other manners may muck be used in the preservation
of manures?</p>

<p>How may liquid manure be made most useful?</p></div>

<p>The foregoing system of composting is the best
that has yet been suggested for making use of solid
manures. Many other methods may be adopted
when circumstances will not admit of so much attention.
It is a common and excellent practice to
throw prepared muck into the cellar under the stables,
to be mixed and turned over with the manure by
swine. In other cases the manures are kept in the
yard, and are covered with a thin layer of muck
every morning. The principle which renders these
systems beneficial is the absorbent power of charcoal.</p>


<h3 class="gap2">LIQUID MANURE.</h3>

<p><i>Liquid manure</i> from animals may, also, be made
useful by the assistance of prepared muck. Where
a tank is used in composting, the liquids from the
stable may all be employed to supply moisture to the
heap; but where any system is adopted, not requir<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>ing
liquids, the urine may be applied to muck heaps,
and then allowed to ferment. Fermentation is necessary
in urine as well as in solid dung, before it is
very active as a manure. Urine, as will be recollected,
contains nitrogen and forms ammonia on fermentation.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Describe the manner of digging out the bottoms of stalls.</p></div>

<p>It is a very good plan to dig out the bottoms of
the stalls in a circular or gutter-like form, three or
four feet deep in the middle, cement the ground,
or make it nearly water-tight, by a plastering of
stiff clay, and fill them up with prepared muck.
The appearance of a cross section of the floor thus
arranged would be as follows:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 581px;">
<img src="images/fig003.png" width="581" height="298" alt="Fig. 3." title="" />
<span class="caption">Fig. 3.</span>
</div>

<p>The prepared muck in the bottom of the stalls
would absorb the urine as soon as voided, while yet
warm with the animal heat, and receive heat from
the animal's body while lying down at night. This<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
heat will hasten the decomposition of the urea,<a name="FNanchor_AA_27" id="FNanchor_AA_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_AA_27" class="fnanchor">[AA]</a>
and if the muck be renewed twice a month, and
that which is removed composted under cover, it
will be found a most prolific source of good manure.
In Flanders, the liquid manure of a cow is considered
worth $10 per year, and it is not less valuable
here. As was stated in the early part of this section,
the inorganic (or mineral) matter contained in
urine, is soluble, and consequently is immediately
useful as food for plants.</p>

<p>By referring to the analysis of liquid and solid
manure, in <a href="#SECTION_FIFTH">section V.</a>, their relative value may be
seen.</p>



<h2 class="gap4">CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3>DIFFERENT KINDS OF ANIMAL EXCREMENT.</h3>


<p>The manures of different animals are, of course, of
different value, as fertilizers, varying according to
the food, the age of the animals, etc.</p>


<h3 class="gap2">STABLE MANURE.</h3>

<p>By stable manure we mean, usually, that of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
horse, and that of horned cattle. The case described
in chap. 2 (of this section), was one where the
animal was not increasing in any of its parts, but
returned, in the form of manure, and otherwise, the
equivalent of every thing eaten. This case is one of
the most simple kind, and is subject to many modifications.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Is the manure of full-grown animals of the same quality as that
of other animals?</p>

<p>Why does that of the growing animal differ?</p>

<p>Why does not the formation of <i>fat</i> reduce the quality of manure?</p>

<p>What does <i>milk</i> remove from the food?</p></div>

<p>The <i>growing</i> animal is increasing in size, and as
he derives his increase from his food, he does not return
in the form of manure as much as he eats. If
his bones are growing, he is taking from his food
phosphate of lime and nitrogenous matter; consequently,
the manure will be poorer in these ingredients.
The same may be said of the formation of
the muscles, in relation to nitrogen.</p>

<p>The <i>fatting</i> animal, if full grown, makes manure
which is as good as that from animals that are not
increasing in size, because the fat is taken from those
parts of the food which is obtained by plants from
the atmosphere, and from nature, (<i>i. e.</i> from the 1st
class of proximates). Fat contains no nitrogen,
and, consequently, does not lessen the amount of
this ingredient in the manure.</p>

<p><i>Milch Cows</i> turn a part of their food to the for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>mation
of milk, and consequently, they produce manure
of reduced value.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>How do the solid and liquid manure of the horse and ox compare?</p>

<p>What occasions these differences?</p></div>

<p>The solid manure of the horse is better than that
of the ox, while the liquid manure of the ox is comparatively
better than that of the horse. The cause
of this is that the horse has poorer digestive organs
than the ox, and consequently passes more of the
valuable parts of his food, in an undigested form, as
dung, while the ox, from chewing the cud and having
more perfect organs, turns more of his food into
urine than the horse.</p>

<h3 class="gap2">NIGHT SOIL.</h3>

<div class="sidenote"><p>What is the most valuable manure accessible to the farmer?</p>

<p>What is the probable value of the night soil yearly lost in the
United States?</p>

<p>Of what does the manure of man consist?</p></div>

<p>The <i>best</i> manure within the reach of the farmer
is <i>night soil</i>, or human excrement. There has always
been a false delicacy about mentioning this fertilizer,
which has caused much waste, and great
loss of health, from the impure and offensive odors
which it is allowed to send forth to taint the air.</p>

<p>The value of the night soil yearly lost in the
United States is, probably, about <i>fifty millions of
dollars</i> (50,000,000); an amount nearly equal to
the entire expenses of our National Government.
Much of the ill health of our people is undoubtedly
occasioned by neglecting the proper treatment of
night soil.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Describe this manure as compared with the excrements of
other animals.</p>

<p>Does the use of night soil produce disagreeable properties in
plants?</p></div>

<p>That which directly affects agriculture, as treated
of in this book, is the value of this substance as a
fertilizer. The manure of man consists (as is the
case with that of other animals) of those parts of
his food which are not retained in the increase of
his body. If he be <i>growing</i>, his manure is poorer,
as in the case of the ox, and it is subject to all
the other modifications named in the early part of
this chapter. His food is usually of a varied character,
and is rich in nitrogen, the phosphates, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
other inorganic constituents; consequently, his manure
is made valuable by containing large quantities
of these matters. As is the case with the ox, the
<i>dung</i> contains the undigested food, the secretions (or
leakings) of the digestive organs, and the insoluble
parts of the ash of the digested food. The <i>urine</i>,
in like manner, contains a large proportion of the
nitrogen and the soluble inorganic parts of the digested
food. When we consider how much richer
the <i>food</i> of man is than that of horned cattle, we
shall see the superior value of his <i>excrement</i>.</p>

<p>Night soil has been used as a manure, for ages,
in China, which is, undoubtedly, one great secret of
their success in supporting a dense population, for
so long a time, without impoverishing the soil. It
has been found, in many instances, to increase the
productive power of the natural soil three-fold.
That is, if a soil would produce ten bushels of wheat
per acre, without manure, it would produce thirty
bushels if manured with night soil.</p>

<p>Some have supposed that manuring with night
soil would give disagreeable properties to plants:
such is not the case; their quality is invariably improved.
The color and odor of the rose become
richer and more delicate by the use of the most offensive
night soil as manure.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>What is the direct object of plants?</p>

<p>What would result if this were not the case?</p>

<p>How may night soil be easily prepared for use, and its offensive
odor prevented?</p></div>

<p>It is evident that this is the case from the fact
that plants have it for their direct object to make
over and put together the refuse organic matter, and
the gases and the minerals found in nature, for the
use of animals. If there were no natural means of
rendering the excrement of animals available to
plants, the earth must soon be shorn of its fertility,
as the elements of growth when once consumed
would be essentially destroyed, and no soil could
survive the exhaustion. There is no reason why the
manure of man should be rejected by vegetation
more than that of any other animal; and indeed it
is not, for ample experience has proved that for most
soils there is no better manure in existence.</p>

<p>A single experiment will suffice to show that
night soil may be so kept that there shall be no loss
of its valuable gases, and consequently no offensive
odor arising from it, while it may be removed and
applied to crops without unpleasantness. All that is
necessary to effect this wonderful change in night soil,
and to turn it from its disagreeable character to one
entirely inoffensive, is to mix with it a little charcoal
dust, prepared muck, or any other good absorbent&mdash;thus
making what is called poudrette.
The mode of doing this must depend on circumstances.
In many cases, it would be expedient to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
keep a barrel of the absorbent in the privy and throw
down a small quantity every day. The effect on the
odor of the house would amply repay the trouble.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Should pure night soil be used as a manure?</p>

<p>What precaution is necessary in preparing hog manure for use?</p></div>

<p>The manure thus made is of the most valuable
character, and may be used under any circumstances
with a certainty of obtaining a good crop. It should
not be used unmixed with some absorbent, as it is of
such strength as to kill plants.</p>

<p>For an analysis of human manure, see <a href="#SECTION_FIFTH">Section V</a>.</p>


<h3 class="gap2">HOG MANURE.</h3>

<p><i>Hog Manure</i> is very valuable, but it must be
used with care. It is so violent in its action that,
when applied in a pure form to crops, it often produces
injurious results. It is liable to make cabbages
<i>clump-footed</i>, and to induce a disease in turnips
called <i>ambury</i> (or fingers and toes). The only precaution
necessary is to supply the stye with prepared
muck, charcoal-dust, leaf-mould, or any absorbent in
plentiful quantities, often adding fresh supplies.
The hogs will work this over with the manure; and,
when required for use, it will be found an excellent
fertilizer. The absorbent will have overcome its injurious
tendency, and it may be safely applied to any
crop. From the variety and rich character of the food
of this animal, his manure is of a superior quality.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Why is the manure from butchers' hog-pens very valuable?</p>

<p>How does the value of poultry manure compare with that of
guano?</p>

<p>How may it be protected against loss?</p></div>

<p><i>Butchers' hog-pen manure</i> is one of the best fertilizers
known. It is made by animals that live
almost entirely on blood and other animal refuse, and
is very rich in nitrogen and the phosphates. It
should be mixed with prepared muck, or its substitute,
to prevent the loss of its ammonia, and as a protection
against its injurious effect on plants.</p>


<h3 class="gap2">POULTRY HOUSE MANURE.</h3>

<p>Next in value to night soil, among domestic manures,
are the excrements of poultry, pigeons, etc.
Birds live on the nice bits of creation, seeds, insects,
etc., and they discharge their solid and liquid excrements
together. Poultry-dung is nearly equal in
value to guano (except that it contains more water),
and it deserves to be carefully preserved and judiciously
used. It is as well worth twenty-five cents
per bushel as guano is worth fifty dollars a ton (at
which price it is now sold).</p>

<p>Poultry-manure is liable to as much injury from
evaporation and leaching as is any other manure, and
equal care should be taken (by the same means) to
prevent such loss. Good shelter over the roosts, and
daily sprinkling with prepared muck or charcoal-dust
will be amply repaid by the increased value of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
the manure, and its better action and greater durability
in the soil. The value of this manure should
be taken into consideration in calculating the profit
of keeping poultry (as indeed with all other stock).
It has been observed by a gentleman of much experience,
in poultry raising, that the yearly manure of
a hundred fowls applied to previously unmanured
land would produce <i>extra</i> corn enough to keep them
for a year. This is probably a large estimate, but it
serves to show that this fertilizer is very valuable, and
also that poultry may be kept with great profit, if
their excrements are properly secured.</p>

<p>The manure of pigeons has been a favorite fertilizer
in some countries for more than 2000 years.</p>

<p>Market gardeners attach much value to rabbit-manure.</p>


<h3 class="gap2">SHEEP MANURE.</h3>

<div class="sidenote"><p>What can you say of the manure of sheep?</p></div>

<p>The manure of sheep is less valuable than it
would be, if so large a quantity of the nitrogen and
mineral parts of the food were not employed in the
formation of wool. This has a great effect on the
richness of the excrements, but they are still a very
good fertilizer, and should be protected from loss in
the same way as stable manure.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>


<h3 class="gap2">GUANO.</h3>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Should the use of guano induce us to disregard other manures?</p>

<p>Where and in what manner is the best guano deposited?</p></div>

<p><i>Guano</i> as a manure has become world renowned.
The worn-out tobacco lands of Virginia, and other
fields in many parts of the country, which seemed to
have yielded to the effect of an ignorant course of
cultivation, and to have sunk to their final repose,
have in many cases been revived to the production of
excellent crops, and have had their value multiplied
many fold by the use of guano. Although an excellent
manure, it should not cause us to lose sight of those
valuable materials which exist on almost every farm.
Every ton of guano imported into the United States
is an addition to our national wealth, but every ton
of stable-manure, or poultry-dung, or night soil
evaporated or carried away in rivers, is equally a <i>deduction</i>
from our riches. If the imported manure is
to really benefit us, we must not allow it to occasion
the neglect and consequent loss of our domestic fertilizers.</p>

<p>The Peruvian guano (which is considered the
best) is brought from islands near the coast of Peru.
The birds which frequent these islands live almost
entirely on fish, and drop their excrements here in
a climate where rain is almost unknown, and where,
from the dryness of the air, there is but little loss<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
sustained by the manure. It is brought to this
country in large quantities, and is an excellent fertilizer,
superior even to night soil.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>How should it be prepared for use?</p></div>

<p>It should be mixed with an absorbent before
being used, unless it is plowed deeply under the soil,
as it contains much ammonia which would be lost from
evaporation. It would probably also injure plants.
The best way to use guano, is in connection with
sulphuric acid and bones, as will be described hereafter.</p>

<p>The composition of the various kinds of guano
may be found in the section on analysis.</p>

<h3>OTHER ORGANIC MANURES.</h3>


<p>The number of organic manures is almost countless.
The most common of these have been described
in the previous chapters on the excrements
of animals. The more prominent of the remaining
ones will now be considered. As a universal rule, it
may be stated that all organic matter (every thing
which has had vegetable or animal life) is capable
of fertilizing plants.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>


<h3 class="gap2">DEAD ANIMALS.</h3>

<div class="sidenote"><p>What are the chief fertilizing constituents of dead animals?</p>

<p>What becomes of these when exposed to the atmosphere?</p>

<p>How may this be prevented?</p></div>

<p>The bodies of animals contain much <i>nitrogen</i>,
as well as valuable quantities, the phosphates and
other inorganic materials required in the growth of
plants. On their decay, the nitrogen is resolved into
<i>ammonia</i>,<a name="FNanchor_AC_29" id="FNanchor_AC_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_AC_29" class="fnanchor">[AC]</a> and the mineral matters become valuable
as food for the inorganic parts of plants.</p>

<p>If the decomposition of animal bodies takes place
in exposed situations, and without proper precautions,
the ammonia escapes into the atmosphere, and much
of the mineral portion is leached out by rains. The
use of absorbents, such as charcoal-dust, prepared
muck, etc., will entirely prevent evaporation, and
will in a great measure serve as a protection against
leaching.</p>

<p>If a dead horse be cut in pieces and mixed with
ten loads of muck, the whole mass will, in a single
season, become a most valuable compost. Small
animals, such as dogs, cats, etc., may be with advantage
buried by the roots of grape-vines or trees.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<h3 class="gap2">BONES.</h3>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Of what do the bones of animals consist?</p>

<p>What is gelatine?</p>

<p>Describe the fertilizing qualities of fish.</p></div>

<p>The <i>bones</i> of animals contain phosphate of lime
and gelatine. The gelatine is a nitrogenous substance,
and produces ammonia on its decomposition.
This subject will be spoken of more fully under the
head of 'phosphate of lime' in the chapter on mineral
manures, as the treatment of bones is more directly
with reference to the fertilizing value of their inorganic
matter.</p>


<h3 class="gap2">FISH.</h3>

<p>In many localities near the sea-shore large quantities
of fish are caught and applied to the soil.
These make excellent manure. They contain much
nitrogen, which renders them strongly ammoniacal
on decomposition. Their bones consist of phosphate
and carbonate of lime; and, being naturally soft,
they decompose in the soil with great facility, and
become available to plants. The scales of fish contain
valuable quantities of nitrogen, phosphate of
lime, etc., all of which are highly useful.</p>

<p>Refuse fishy matters from markets and from the
house are well worth saving. These and fish caught
for manure may be made into compost with prepared<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
muck, etc.; and, as they putrefy rapidly, they soon
become ready for use. They may be added to the
compost of stable manure with great advantage.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Should these be applied as a top dressing to the soil?</p>

<p>What are the fertilizing properties of woollen rags?</p>

<p>What is the best way to use them?</p></div>

<p>Fish (like all other nitrogenous manures) should
never be applied as a top dressing, unless previously
mixed with a good absorbent of ammonia, but should
when used alone be immediately plowed under to considerable
depth, to prevent the evaporation&mdash;and consequent
loss&mdash;of their fertilizing gases.</p>


<h3 class="gap2">WOOLLEN RAGS, ETC.</h3>

<p><i>Woollen rags, hair, waste of woollen factories</i>, etc.,
contain both nitrogen and phosphate of lime; and,
like all other matters containing these ingredients,
are excellent manures, but must be used in such a
way as to prevent the escape of their fertilizing gases.
They decompose slowly, and are therefore considered
a <i>lasting</i> manure. Like all <i>lasting</i> manures, however,
they are <i>slow</i> in their effects, and the most advantageous
way to use them is to compost them with
stable manure, or with some other rapidly fermenting
substance, which will hasten their decomposition
and render them sooner available.</p>

<p>Rags, hair, etc., thus treated, will in a short
time be reduced to such a condition that they may
be immediately used by plants instead of lying in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
soil to be slowly taken up. It is better in all cases
to have manures act <i>quickly</i> and give an immediate
return for their cost, than to lie for a long time in
the soil before their influence is felt.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>What is their value compared with that of farm-yard manure?</p>

<p>How should old leather be treated?</p>

<p>Describe the manurial properties of tanners' refuse.</p>

<p>How should they be treated?</p>

<p>Are horn piths, etc. valuable?</p></div>

<p>A pound of woollen rags is worth, as a manure,
twice as much as is paid for good linen shreds for
paper making; still, while the latter are always preserved,
the former are thrown away, although considered
by good judges to be worth forty times as
much as barn-yard manure.</p>

<p>Old leather should not be thrown away. It decomposes
very slowly, and consequently is of but a
little value; but, if put at the roots of young trees,
it will in time produce appreciable effects.</p>

<p><i>Tanners' and curriers' refuse</i>, and all other animal
offal, including that of the slaughter-house, is
well worth attention, as it contains more or less of
those two most important ingredients of manures,
nitrogen and phosphate of lime.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to add that, in common with
all other animal manures, these substances must be
either composted, or immediately plowed under
the soil. Horn piths, and horn shavings, if decomposed
in compost, with substances which ferment
rapidly, make very good manure, and are worth fully
the price charged for them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>


<h3 class="gap2">ORGANIC MANURES OF VEGETABLE ORIGIN.</h3>

<p><i>Muck</i>, the most important of the purely vegetable
manures, has been already sufficiently described.
It should be particularly borne in mind that, when
first taken from the swamp it is often <i>sour</i>, or <i>cold</i>,
but that if exposed for a long time to the air, or if
well treated with lime, unleached ashes, the lime
and salt mixture, or any other alkali, its acids will
be <i>neutralized</i> (or overcome), and it becomes a good
application to any soil, except peat or other soils already
containing large quantities of organic matter.
In applying muck to the soil (as has been before
stated), it should be made a vehicle for carrying
ammoniacal manures.</p>


<h3 class="gap2">SPENT TAN BARK.</h3>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Why is decomposed bark more fertilizing than that of decayed
wood?</p></div>

<p><i>Spent tan bark</i>, if previously decomposed by the
use of the lime and salt mixture, or potash, answers
all the purposes of prepared muck, but is more difficult
of decomposition.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>How may bark be decomposed?</p>

<p>Why should tan bark be composted with an alkali?</p>

<p>Why is it good for mulching?</p>

<p>Is sawdust of any value?</p></div>

<p>The bark of trees contains a larger proportion of
inorganic matter than the wood, and much of this,
on the decomposition of the bark, becomes available
as manure. The chemical effect on the bark, of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
using it in the tanning of leather, is such as to render
it difficult to be rotted by the ordinary means,
but, by the use of the lime and salt mixture it may
be reduced to the finest condition, and becomes a
most excellent manure. It probably contains small
quantities of nitrogen (obtained from the leather),
which adds to its value. Unless tan bark be composted
with lime, or some other alkali, it may produce
injurious effects from the <i>tannic acid</i> which it
is liable to contain. Alkaline substances will neutralize
this acid, and prevent it from being injurious.</p>

<p>One great benefit resulting from the use of spent
tan bark, is due to its power of absorbing moisture
from the atmosphere. For this reason it is very valuable
for <i>mulching</i><a name="FNanchor_AD_30" id="FNanchor_AD_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_AD_30" class="fnanchor">[AD]</a> young trees and plants when
first set out.</p>


<h3 class="gap2">SAWDUST.</h3>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Why is sawdust a good addition to the pig-stye?</p>

<p>What is the peculiarity of sawdust from the beech, etc.?</p>

<p>What is a peculiarity of soot?</p>

<p>Why may soot be used as a top dressing without losing its
ammonia?</p></div>

<p><i>Sawdust</i> in its natural state is of very little value
to the land, but when decomposed, as may be
done by the same method as was described for tan
bark, it is of some importance, as it contains a large
quantity of carbon. Its ash, too, which becomes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
available, contains soluble inorganic matter, and in
this way it acts as a direct manure. So far as concerns
the value of the ash, however, the bark is superior
to sawdust. Sawdust may be partially rotted
by mixing it with strong manure (as hog manure),
while it acts as a <i>divisor</i>, and prevents the too rapid
action of this when applied to the soil. Some
kinds of sawdust, such as that from beech wood,
form acetic acid on their decomposition, and these
should be treated with, at least, a sufficient quantity
of lime to correct the acid.</p>

<p><i>Soot</i> is a good manure. It contains much carbon,
and has, thus far, all of the beneficial effects of charcoal
dust. The sulphur, which is one of its constituents,
not only serves as food for plants, but, from
its odor, is a good protection against some insects.
By throwing a handful of soot on a melon vine, or
young cabbage plant, it will keep away many insects.</p>

<p>Soot contains some ammonia, and as this is in
the form of a <i>sulphate</i>, it is not volatile, and consequently
does not evaporate when the soot is applied
as a top dressing, which is the almost universal custom.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>


<h3 class="gap2">GREEN CROPS.</h3>

<div class="sidenote"><p>What plants are most used as green crops?</p>

<p>What office is performed by the roots of green crops?</p>

<p>How do such manures increase the organic matter of soils?</p></div>

<p><i>Green crops</i>, to plow under, are in many places
largely raised, and are always beneficial. The plants
most used for this purpose, in our country, are clover,
buckwheat, and peas. These plants have very long
roots, which they send deep in the soil, to draw up
mineral matter for their support. This mineral
matter is deposited in the plant. The leaves and
roots receive carbonic acid and ammonia from the
air, and from water. In this manner they obtain
their carbon. When the crop is turned under the
soil, it decomposes, and the carbon, as well as the
mineral ingredients obtained from the subsoil, are
deposited in the surface soil, and become of use to
succeeding crops. The hollow stalks of the buckwheat
and pea, serve as tubes, in the soil, for the
passage of air, and thus, in heavy soils, give a much
needed circulation of atmospheric fertilizers.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>What office is performed by the straw of the buckwheat and
pea?</p>

<p>What treatment may be substituted for the use of green crops?</p>

<p>Which course should be adopted in high farming?</p>

<p>Why is the use of green crops preferable in ordinary cultivation?</p>

<p>Name some other valuable manures.</p></div>

<p>Although green crops are of great benefit, and
are managed with little labor, there is no doubt but
the same results may be more economically produced.
A few loads of prepared muck will do more towards
increasing the organic matter in the soil, than a very
heavy crop of clover, while it would be ready for
immediate cultivation, instead of having to lie idle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
during the year required in the production and decomposition
of the green crop. The effect of the
roots penetrating the subsoil is, as we have seen, to
draw up inorganic matter, to be deposited within
reach of the roots of future crops. In the next section
we shall show that this end may be much more
efficiently attained by the use of the sub-soil plow,
which makes a passage for the roots into the subsoil,
where they can obtain for themselves what would, in
the other case, be brought up for them by the roots
of the green crop.</p>

<p>The offices of the hollow straws may be performed
by a system of ridging and back furrowing, having
previously covered the soil with leaves, or other refuse
organic material.</p>

<p>In <i>high farming</i>, where the object of the cultivator
is to make a profitable investment of labor,
these last named methods will be found most
expedient; but, if the farmer have a large quantity
of land, and can afford but a limited amount of labor,
the raising of green crops, to be plowed under
in the fall, will probably be adopted.</p>

<p>Before closing this chapter, it may be well to remark
that there are various other fertilizers, such as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
the <i>ammoniacal liquor of gas-houses</i>, <i>soapers' wastes</i>,
<i>bleachers' lye</i>, <i>lees of old oil casks, etc.</i>, which we
have not space to consider at length, but which are
all valuable as additions to the compost heap, or as
applications, in a liquid form, to the soil.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>What are the advantages arising from burying manure in its
green state?</p>

<p>Which is generally preferable, this course, or composting?
Why?</p></div>

<p>In many cases (when heavy manuring is practised),
it may be well to apply organic manures to
the soil in a green state, turn them under, and allow
them to undergo decomposition in the ground. The
advantages of this system are, that the <i>heat</i>, resulting
from the chemical changes, will hasten the growth
of plants, by making the soil warmer; the carbonic
acid formed will be presented to the roots instead of
escaping into the atmosphere; and if the soil be
heavy, the rising of the gases will tend to loosen it,
and the leaving vacant of the spaces occupied by the
solid matters will, on their being resolved into gases,
render the soil of a more porous character. As a
general rule, however, in ordinary farming, where the
amount of manure applied is only sufficient for the
supply of food to the crop, it is undoubtedly better
to have it previously decomposed&mdash;<i>cooked</i> as it were,
for the uses of the plants&mdash;as they can then obtain
the required amount of nutriment as fast as needed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>


<h3 class="gap2">ABSORPTION OF MOISTURE.</h3>

<p>It is often convenient to know the relative power
of different manures to absorb moisture from the
atmosphere, especially when we wish to manure
lands that suffer from drought. The following results
are given by C. W. Johnson, in his essay on
salt, (pp. 8 and 19). In these experiments the animal
manures were employed without any admixture
of straw.</p>

<h3 class="gap2">DISTRIBUTION OF MANURES.</h3>

<p>The following table from Johnson, on manures,
will be found convenient in the distribution of manures.</p>

<p>By its assistance the farmer will know how
many loads of manure he requires, dividing each
load into a stated number of heaps, and placing
them at certain distances. In this manner manure
may be applied evenly, and calculation may be made
as to the amount, per acre, which a certain quantity
will supply.<a name="FNanchor_AF_32" id="FNanchor_AF_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_AF_32" class="fnanchor">[AF]</a></p>

<h3>MINERAL MANURES.</h3>


<div class="sidenote"><p>How many kinds of action have inorganic manures?</p>

<p>What is the first of these? The second? Third? Fourth?</p>

<p>Do all mineral manures possess all of these qualities?</p></div>

<p>The second class of manures named in the gene<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>ral
division of the subject, in the early part of this
chapter, comprises those of a mineral character, or
<i>inorganic</i> manures.</p>

<p>These manures have four kinds of action when
applied to the soil.</p>

<p>1st. They furnish food for the inorganic part of
plants.</p>

<p>2d. They prepare matters already in the soil, for
assimilation by roots.</p>

<p>3d. They improve the mechanical condition of
the soil.</p>

<p>4th. They absorb ammonia.</p>

<p>Some of the mineral manures produce in the soil
only one of these effects, and others are efficient in
two or all of them.</p>

<p>The principles to be considered in the use of
mineral manures are essentially given in the first
two sections of this book. It may be well, however,
to repeat them briefly in this connection, and to give
the <i>reasons</i> why any of these manures are needed,
from which we may learn what rules are to be observed
in their application.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Relate what you know of the properties of vegetable ashes?</p>

<p>How does this relate to the fertility of the soil?</p>

<p>According to what two rules may we apply mineral manures?</p>

<p>What course would you pursue to raise potatoes on a soil containing
a very little phosphoric acid and no potash?</p></div>

<p>1st. Those which are used as food by plants. It
will be recollected that the <i>ash</i> left after burning
plants, and which formed a part of their structures,
has a certain chemical composition; that is, it consists
of alkalies, acids, and neutrals. It was also<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
stated that the ashes of plants of the same kind are
always of about the same composition, while the
ashes of different kinds of plants may vary materially.
Different parts of the same plant too, as we learned,
are supplied with different kinds of ash.</p>

<p>For instance, <i>clover</i>, on being burned, leaves
an ash containing <i>lime</i>, as one of its principal ingredients,
while the ash of <i>potatoes</i> contains more of
<i>potash</i> than of any thing else.</p>

<p>In the second section (on soils), we learned that
some soils contain every thing necessary to make the
ashes of all plants, and in sufficient quantity to supply
what is required, while other soils are either
entirely deficient in one or more ingredients, or contain
so little of them that they are unfertile for certain
plants.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Would you manure it in the same way for wheat?</p>

<p>Why?</p></div>

<p>From this, we see that we may pursue either one
of two courses. After we know the exact composition
of the soil&mdash;which we can learn only from correct
analysis&mdash;we may manure it with a view either
to making it fertile for all kinds of plants or only for
one particular plant. For instance, we may find
that a soil contains a very little phosphoric acid, and
no potash. If we wish to raise potatoes on such a
soil, we have only to apply potash (if the soil is good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
in other particulars), which is largely required by this
plant, though it needs but little phosphoric acid;
while, if we wish to make it fertile for wheat, and all
other plants, we must apply more phosphoric acid
as well as potash. As a universal rule, it may
be stated that to render a soil fertile for any particular
plant, we must supply it (unless it already
contains them) with those matters which are necessary
to <i>make</i> the ash of that plant; and, if we would
render it capable of producing <i>all</i> kinds of plants, it
must be furnished with the materials required in the
formation of <i>all kinds of vegetable ashes</i>.</p>

<p>It is not absolutely necessary to have the soil
analyzed before it can be cultivated with success,
but it is the <i>cheapest</i> way.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>How is the fertility of the soil to be maintained, if the crops
are <i>sold</i>?</p>

<p>What rule is given for general treatment?</p>

<p>Give an instance of matters in the soil that are to be rendered
available by mineral manures?</p></div>

<p>We might proceed from an analysis of the plant
required (which will be found in <a href="#SECTION_FIFTH">Section V.</a>), and
apply to the soil in the form of manure every thing
that is necessary for the formation of the ash of
that plant. This would give a good crop on <i>any</i>
soil that was in the proper <i>mechanical</i> condition, and
contained enough organic matter; but a moment's
reflection will show that, if the soil contained a large
amount of potash, or of phosphate of lime, it would
not be necessary to make an application of more of
these ingredients&mdash;at an expense of perhaps three
times the cost of an analysis. It is true that, if the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
crop is <i>sold</i>, and it is desired to maintain the fertility
of the soil, the full amount of the ash must be applied,
either before or after the crop is grown; but, in the
ordinary use of crops for feeding purposes, a large
part of the ash will exist in the excrements of the
animals; so that the judicious farmer will be able to
manure his land with more economy than if he had
to apply to each crop the whole amount and variety
required for its ash. The best rule for practical
manuring is probably to <i>strengthen the soil in its
weaker points, and prevent the stronger ones from
becoming weaker</i>. In this way, the soil may be
raised to the highest state of fertility, and be fully
maintained in its productive powers.</p>

<p>2d. Those manures which render available matter
already contained in the soil.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>How may silica be developed?</p>

<p>How does lime affect soils containing coarse particles?</p>

<p>How do mineral manures sometimes improve the mechanical
texture of the soil?</p></div>

<p>Silica (or sand), it will be recollected, exists in
all soils; but, in its pure state, is not capable of
being dissolved, and therefore cannot be used by
plants. The alkalies (as has been stated), have the
power of combining with this silica, making compounds,
which are called <i>silicates</i>. These are
readily dissolved by water, and are available in vegetable
growth. Now, if a soil is deficient in these
soluble silicates, it is well known that grain, etc.,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
grown on it, not being able to obtain the material
which gives them strength, will fall down or <i>lodge</i>; but,
if such measures be taken, as will render the sand
soluble, the straw will be strong and healthy. Alkalies
used for this purpose, come under the head of those
manures which develope the natural resources of the
soil.</p>

<p>Again, much of the mineral matter in the soil is
combined within particles, and is therefore out of the
reach of roots. Lime, among other thing, has the
effect of causing these particles to crumble and expose
their constituents to the demand of roots.
Therefore, lime has for one of its offices the development
of the fertilizing ingredients of the soil.</p>

<p>3d. Those manures which improve the mechanical
condition of the soil.</p>

<p>The alkalies, in combining with sand, commence
their action on the surfaces of the particles, and
roughen them&mdash;<i>rust</i> them as it were. This roughening
of particles of the soil prevents them from moving
among each other as easily as they do when they are
smooth, and thus keeps the soil from being compacted
by heavy rains, as it is liable to be in its natural
condition. In this way, the mechanical texture
of the soil is improved.</p>

<p>It has just been said that <i>lime</i> causes the pul<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>verization
of the particles of the soil; and thus, by
making it finer, improves its mechanical condition.</p>

<p>Some mineral manures, as plaster and salt, have
the power of absorbing moisture from the atmosphere;
and this is a mechanical improvement to dry soils.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Name some mineral manures which absorb ammonia?</p></div>

<p>4th. Those mineral manures which have the
power of absorbing ammonia.</p>

<p><i>Plaster</i>, <i>chloride of lime</i>, <i>alumina</i> (<i>clay</i>), etc.,
are large absorbents of ammonia, whether arising
from the fermentation of animal manures or washed
down from the atmosphere by rains. The ammonia
thus absorbed is of course very important in the
vegetation of crops.</p>

<p>Having now explained the reasons why mineral
manures are necessary, and the manner in which
they produce their effects, we will proceed to examine
the various deficiencies of soils and the character of
many kinds of this class of fertilizers.</p>



<h2 class="gap4">CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<h3>DEFICIENCIES OF SOILS, MEANS OF
RESTORATION, ETC.</h3>


<p>As will be seen by referring to the analyses of soils<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
on p. 72, they may be deficient in certain ingredients,
which it is the object of mineral manures to
supply. These we will take up in order, and endeavor
to show in a simple manner the best means of
managing them in practical farming.</p>


<h3 class="gap2">ALKALIES.</h3>

<h3 class="gap2">POTASH.</h3>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Do all soils contain a sufficient amount of potash?</p>

<p>How may its deficiency have been caused?</p>

<p>How may its absence be detected?</p>

<p>Does barn-yard manure contain sufficient potash to supply its
deficiency in worn-out soils?</p></div>

<p><i>Potash</i> is often deficient in the soil. Its deficiency
may have been caused in two ways. Either
it may not have existed largely in the rock from
which the soil was formed, and consequently is
equally absent from the soil itself, or it may have
once been present in sufficient quantities, and been
carried away in crops, without being returned to the
soil in the form of manure until too little remains for
the requirements of fertility.</p>

<p>In either case, its absence may be accurately detected
by a skilful chemist, and it may be supplied
by the farmer in various ways. Potash, as well as
all of the other mineral manures, is contained in
the excrements of animals, but not (as is also the
case with the others) in sufficient quantities to
restore the proper balance to soils where it is largely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
deficient, nor even to make up for what is yearly
removed with each crop, except that crop (or its
equivalent) has been fed to such animals as return
<i>all</i> of the fertilizing constituents of their food in the
form of manure, and this be all carefully preserved
and applied to the soil. In all other cases, it is necessary
to apply more potash than is contained in the
excrements of animals.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>What is generally the most available source from which to obtain
this alkali?</p>

<p>Will leached ashes answer the same purpose?</p>

<p>How may ashes be used?</p></div>

<p><i>Unleached wood ashes</i> is generally the most
available source from which to obtain this alkali.
The ashes of all kinds of wood contain potash (more
or less according to the kind&mdash;see analysis section
V.) If the ashes are <i>leached</i>, the potash is removed;
and, hence for the purpose of supplying it, they are
worthless; but <i>unleached</i> ashes are an excellent
source from which to obtain it. They may be made
into compost with muck, as directed in a previous
chapter, or applied directly to the soil. In either
case the potash is available directly to the plant, or is
capable of uniting with the silica in the soil to form
silicate of potash. Neither potash nor any other
alkali should ever be applied to animal manures
unless in compost with an absorbent, as they cause
the ammonia to be thrown off and lost.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>From what other sources may potash be obtained?</p>

<p>How may we obtain soda?</p>

<p>In what quantities should pure salt be applied to the soil?</p></div>

<p><i>Potash sparlings</i>, or the refuse of potash ware<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>houses,
is an excellent manure for lands deficient in
this constituent.</p>

<p><i>Potash marl</i>, such as is found in New Jersey,
contains a large proportion of potash, and is an excellent
application to soils requiring it.</p>

<p><i>Feldspar</i>, <i>kaolin</i>, and other minerals containing
potash, are, in some localities, to be obtained in sufficient
quantities to be used for manurial purposes.</p>

<p><i>Granite</i> contains potash, and if it can be crushed
(as is the case with some of the softer kinds,) it
serves a very good purpose.</p>


<h3 class="gap2">SODA.</h3>

<div class="sidenote"><p>If applied in large quantities will it produce permanent injury?</p>

<p>In what quantities should salt be applied to composts? To
asparagus?</p></div>

<p><i>Soda</i>, the requirement of which is occasioned
by the same causes as create a deficiency of potash,
and all of the other ingredients of vegetable ashes,
may be very readily supplied by the use of <i>common
salt</i> (chloride of sodium), which consists of about one
half sodium (the base of soda). The best way to
use salt is in the lime and salt mixture, previously
described, or as a direct application to the soil. If
too much salt be given to the soil it will kill any
plant. In small quantities, however, it is highly
beneficial, and if <i>six bushels per acre</i> be sown broadcast
over the land, to be carried in by rains and dews,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
it will not only destroy many insects (grubs, worms,
etc.), but will, after decomposing and becoming
chlorine and soda, prove an excellent manure. Salt,
even in quantities large enough to denude the soil of
all vegetation, is never <i>permanently</i> injurious. After
the first year, it becomes resolved into its constituents,
and furnishes chlorine and soda to plants, without
injuring them. One bushel of salt in each cord
of compost will not only hasten the decomposition
of the manures, but will kill all seeds and grubs&mdash;a
very desirable effect. While small quantities of salt
in a compost heap are beneficial, too much (as when
applied to the soil) is positively injurious, as it arrests
decomposition; fairly <i>pickles</i> the manures, and
prevents them from rotting.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>What is generally the best way to use salt?</p>

<p>What is nitrate of soda?</p>

<p>What plants contain lime?</p></div>

<p>For <i>asparagus</i>, which is a marine plant, salt is
an excellent manure, and may be applied in almost
unlimited quantities, <i>while the plants are growing</i>,
if used after they have gone to top, it is injurious.
Salt has been applied to asparagus beds in such quantities
as to completely cover them, and with apparent
benefit to the plants. Of course large doses of salt
kill all weeds, and thus save labor and the injury to
the asparagus roots, which would result from their
removal by hoeing. Salt may be used advantageously
in any of the foregoing manners, but should always
be applied with care. For ordinary farm purposes,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
it is undoubtedly most profitable to use the salt with
lime, and make it perform the double duty of assisting
in the decomposition of vegetable matter, and
fertilizing the soil.</p>

<p>Soda unites with the silica in the soil, and forms
the valuable <i>silicate of soda</i>.</p>

<p><i>Nitrate of soda</i>, or cubical nitre, which is found
in South America, consists of soda and nitric acid.
It furnishes both soda and nitrogen to plants, and is
an excellent manure.</p>


<h3 class="gap2">LIME.</h3>

<p>The subject of <i>lime</i> is one of most vital importance
to the farmer; indeed, so varied are its modes
of action and its effects, that some writers have given
it credit for every thing good in the way of farming,
and have gone so far as to say that <i>all</i> permanent
improvement of agriculture must depend on the use
of lime. Although this is far in excess of the truth
(as lime cannot plow, nor drain, nor supply any thing
but <i>lime</i> to the soil), its many beneficial effects demand
for it the closest attention.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Do all soils contain enough lime for the use of plants?</p>

<p>What amount is needed for this purpose?</p>

<p>What is its first-named effect on the soil?</p>

<p>Its second? Third? Fourth? Fifth?</p>

<p>How are acids produced in the soil?</p></div>

<p>As food for plants, lime is of considerable importance.
All plants contain lime&mdash;some of them in
large quantities. It is an important constituent of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
straw, meadow hay, leaves of fruit trees, peas, beans,
and turnips. It constitutes more than one third of
the ash of red clover. Many soils contain lime
enough for the use of plants, in others it is deficient,
and must be supplied artificially before they can produce
good crops of those plants of which lime is an
important ingredient. The only way in which the
exact quantity of lime in the soil can be ascertained
is by chemical analysis. However, the amount required
for the mere feeding plants is not large,
(much less than one per cent.), but lime is often
necessary for other purposes; and setting aside, for
the present, its feeding action, we will examine its
various effects on the mechanical and chemical condition
of the soil.</p>

<p>1. It corrects acidity (sourness).</p>

<p>2. It hastens the decomposition of the organic
matter in the soil.</p>

<p>3. It causes the mineral particles of the soil to
crumble.</p>

<p>4. By producing the above effects, it prepares
the constituents of the soil for assimilation by plants.</p>

<p>5. It is <i>said</i> to exhaust the soil, but it does so in a
very desirable manner, the injurious effects of which
may be easily avoided.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>How does lime correct them?</p>

<p>How does it affect animal manures in the soil?</p></div>

<p>1. The decomposition of organic matter in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
soil, often produces acids which makes the land <i>sour</i>,
and cause it to produce sorrel and other weeds,
which interfere with the healthy growth of crops.
Lime is an <i>alkali</i>, and if applied to soils suffering
from sourness, it will unite with the acids, and neutralize
them, so that they will no longer be injurious.</p>

<p>2. We have before stated that lime is a decomposing
agent, and hastens the rotting of muck and
other organic matter. It has the same effect on the
organic parts of the soil, and causes them to be resolved
into the gases and minerals of which they are
formed. It has this effect, especially, on organic
matters containing <i>nitrogen</i>, causing them to throw
off ammonia; consequently, it liberates this gas
from the animal manures in the soil.</p>

<p>3. Various inorganic compounds in the soil are
so affected by lime, that they lose their power of
holding together, and crumble, or are reduced to
finer particles, while some of their constituents are
rendered soluble. One way in which this is accomplished
is by the action of the lime on the silica contained
in these compounds, forming the silicate of
lime. This crumbling effect improves the mechanical
as well as the chemical condition of the soil.</p>

<p>4. We are now enabled to see how lime prepares
the constituents of the soil for the use of plants.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Inorganic compounds?</p>

<p>How does lime prepare the constituents of the soil for use?</p>

<p>What can you say of the remark that lime exhausts the organic
matter in the soil?</p></div>

<p>By its action on the roots, buried stubble, and
other organic matter in the soil, it causes them to
be decomposed, and to give up many of their gaseous
and inorganic constituents for the use of roots. In
this manner the organic matter is prepared for use
more rapidly than would be the case, if there were
no lime present to hasten its decomposition.</p>

<p>By the decomposing action of lime on the mineral
parts of the soil (3), they also are placed more
rapidly in a useful condition than would be the case,
if their preparation depended on the slow action of atmospheric
influences.</p>

<p>Thus, we see that lime, aside from its use directly
as food for plants, exerts a beneficial influence on
both the organic and inorganic parts of the soil.</p>

<p>5. Many contend that lime <i>exhausts</i> the soil.</p>

<p>If we examine the manner in which it does so,
we shall see that this is no argument against its use.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>How can lime exhaust the mineral parts of the soil?</p>

<p>Must the matter taken away be returned to the soil?</p></div>

<p>It exhausts the organic parts of the soil, by decomposing
them, and resolving them into the gases
and minerals of which they are composed. If the
soil do not contain a sufficient quantity of absorbent
matter, such as clay or charcoal, the gases arising
from the organic matter are liable to escape; but
when there is a sufficient amount of these substances
present (as there always should be), these gases are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
all retained until required by the roots of plants.
Hence, although the organic matter of manure and
vegetable substances may be <i>altered in form</i>, by
the use of lime, it can escape (except in very poor
soils) only as it is taken up by roots to feed the
crop, and such exhaustion is certainly profitable;
still, in order that the fertility of the soil may be
<i>maintained</i>, enough of organic manure should be
applied, to make up for the amount taken from the
soil by the crop, after liberation for its use by the
action of the lime. This will be but a small proportion
of the organic matter contained in the crop, as
it obtains the larger part from the atmosphere.</p>

<p>The only way in which lime can exhaust the inorganic
part of the soil is, by altering its condition,
so that plants can use it more readily. That is, it
exposes it for solution in water. We have seen that
fertilizing matter cannot be leached out of a good
soil, in any material quantity, but can only be carried
down to a depth of about thirty-four inches.
Hence, we see that there can be no loss in this direction;
and, as inorganic matter cannot evaporate
from the soil, the only way in which it can escape
is through the structure of plants.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>If this course be pursued, will the soil suffer from the use of
lime?</p>

<p>Is it the lime, or its crop, that exhausts the soil?</p>

<p>Is lime containing magnesia better than pure lime?</p>

<p>What is the best kind of lime?</p></div>

<p>If lime is applied to the soil, and increases the
amount of crops grown by furnishing a larger supply
of inorganic matter, of course, the removal of inor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>ganic
substances from the soil will be more rapid
than when only a small amount of crop is grown,
and the soil will be sooner exhausted&mdash;not by the
lime, but by the plants. In order to make up for
this exhaustion, it is necessary that a sufficient
amount of inorganic matter be supplied to compensate
for the increased quantity taken away by
plants.</p>

<p>Thus we see, that it is hardly fair to accuse the
<i>lime</i> of exhausting the soil, when it only improves its
character, and increases the amount of its yield. It
is the <i>crop</i> that takes away the fertility of the soil
(the same as would be the case if no lime were used,
only faster as the crop is larger), and in all judicious
cultivation, this loss will be fully compensated by the
application of manures, thereby preventing the exhaustion
of the soil.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Is the purchase of marl to be recommended?</p>

<p>How is lime prepared for use? (Note.)</p>

<p>Describe the burning and slaking of lime.</p></div>

<p><i>Kind of lime to be used.</i> The first consideration
in procuring lime for manuring land, is to select that
which contains but little, if any <i>magnesia</i>. Nearly
all stone lime contains more or less of this, but some
kinds contain more than others. When magnesia
is applied to the soil, in too large quantities, it is
positively injurious to plants, and great care is necessary
in making selection. As a general rule, it may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
be stated, that the best plastering lime makes the
best manure. Such kinds only should be used as
are known from experiment not to be injurious.</p>

<p><i>Shell lime</i> is undoubtedly the best of all, for it
contains no magnesia, and it does contain a small
quantity of <i>phosphate of lime</i>. In the vicinity of
the sea-coast, and near the lines of railroads, oyster
shells, clam shells, etc., can be cheaply procured.
These may be prepared for use in the same manner
as stone lime.<a name="FNanchor_AG_33" id="FNanchor_AG_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_AG_33" class="fnanchor">[AG]</a></p>

<p><i>The preparation of the lime</i> is done by first burning
and then slaking, or by putting it directly on
the land, in an unslaked condition, after its having
been burned. Shells are sometimes <i>ground</i>, and
used without burning; this is hardly advisable, as
they cannot be made so fine as by burning and slaking.
As was stated in the first section of this book,
lime usually exists in nature, in the form of carbonate
of lime, as limestone, chalk, or marble (being
lime and carbonic acid combined), and when this is
burned, the carbonic acid is thrown off, leaving the
lime in a pure or caustic form. This is called burned
lime, quick-lime, lime shells, hot lime, etc. If<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
the proper quantity of water be poured on it, it is
immediately taken up by the lime, which falls into
a dry powder, called <i>slaked lime</i>. If <i>quick-lime</i>
were left exposed to the weather, it would absorb
moisture from the atmosphere, and become what is
termed <i>air slaked</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>What is air slaking?</p>

<p>If slaked lime be exposed to the air, what change does it undergo?</p>

<p>What is the object of slaking lime?</p>

<p>How much carbonic acid is contained in a ton of carbonate of
lime?</p>

<p>How much lime does a ton of slaked lime contain?</p>

<p>What is the most economical form for transportation?</p></div>

<p>When <i>slaked lime</i> (consisting of lime and water)
is exposed to the atmosphere, it absorbs carbonic
acid, and becomes carbonate of lime again; but it is
now in the form of a very fine powder, and is much
more useful than when in the stone.</p>

<p>If quick-lime is applied directly to the soil, it
absorbs first moisture, and then carbonic acid, becoming
finally a powdered carbonate of lime.</p>

<p>One ton of <i>carbonate of lime</i> contains 11&frac14; cwt.
of lime; the remainder is carbonic acid. One ton
of <i>slaked lime</i> contains about 15 cwt. of lime; the
remainder is water.</p>

<p>Hence we see that lime should be burned, and
not slaked, before being transported, as it would be
unprofitable to transport the large quantity of carbonic
acid and water contained in carbonate of lime
and slaked lime. The quick-lime may be slaked,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
and carbonated after reaching its destination, either
before or after being applied to the land.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>What is the best form for immediate action on the inorganic
matter in the soil?</p>

<p>For most other purposes?</p></div>

<p>As has been before stated, much is gained by
slaking lime with <i>salt water</i>, thus imitating the lime
and salt mixture. Indeed in many cases, it will be
found profitable to use all lime in this way. Where
a direct action on the inorganic matters contained in
the soil is desired, it may be well to apply the lime
directly in the form of quick-lime; but, where the
decomposition of the vegetable and animal constituents
of the soil is desired, the correction of <i>sourness</i>,
or the supplying of lime to the crop, the mixture
with salt would be advisable.</p>

<p><i>The amount of lime</i> required <i>by plants</i> is, as was
before observed, usually small compared with the
whole amount contained in the soil; still it is not unimportant.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>What is the best guide concerning the quantity of lime to be
applied?</p>

<p>What is said of the sinking of lime in the soil?</p>

<p>What is plaster of Paris composed of?</p>

<p>Why is it called plaster of Paris?</p></div>

<p>The amount of lime required at each application,
and the frequency of those applications, must depend
on the chemical and mechanical condition of the soil.
No exact rule can be given, but probably the custom
of each district&mdash;regulated by long experience&mdash;is
the best guide.</p>

<p><i>Lime sinks in the soil</i>; and therefore, when
used alone, should always be applied as a top dressing
to be carried into the soil by rains. The tendency of
lime to settle is so great that, when cutting drains,
it may often be observed in a whitish streak on the
top of the subsoil. After heavy doses of lime have
been given to the soil, and have settled so as to have
apparently ceased from their action, they may be
brought up and mixed with the soil by deeper plowing.</p>

<p><i>Lime should never be mixed with animal manures</i>,
unless in compost with muck, or some other good
absorbent, as it is liable to cause the escape of their
ammonia.</p>


<h3 class="gap2">PLASTER OF PARIS.</h3>

<p><i>Plaster of Paris or Gypsum</i> (sulphate of lime)
is composed of sulphuric acid and lime in combination.
It is called 'plaster of Paris,' because it constitutes
the rock underlying the city of Paris.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Is it a constituent of plants?</p>

<p>What else does it furnish them?</p>

<p>How does it affect manure?</p>

<p>How does it produce sorrel in the soil?</p>

<p>How may the acidity be overcome?</p></div>

<p>It is a constituent of many plants. It also furnishes
them with sulphur&mdash;a constituent of the sulphuric
acid which it contains.</p>

<p>It is an excellent absorbent of ammonia, and is
very useful to sprinkle around stables, poultry houses,
pig-styes, and privies, where it absorbs the escaping
gases, saving them for the use of plants, and
purifying the air, thus rendering stables, etc., more
healthy than when not so supplied.</p>

<p>It has been observed that the extravagant use
of plaster sometimes induces the growth of <i>sorrel</i>.
This is probably the case only where the soil is
deficient in lime. In such instances, the lime required
by plants is obtained by the decomposition of
the plaster. The lime enters into the construction
of the plant, and the sulphuric acid remains <i>free</i>,
rendering the soil <i>sour</i>, and therefore in condition to
produce sorrel. In such a case, an application of
<i>lime</i> will correct the acid by uniting with it and converting
it into <i>plaster</i>.</p>


<h3 class="gap2">CHLORIDE OF LIME.</h3>

<div class="sidenote"><p>What does chloride of lime supply to plants?</p>

<p>How does it affect manures?</p>

<p>How may it be used?</p>

<p>How may magnesia be supplied, when wanting?</p>

<p>What care is necessary concerning the use of magnesia?</p></div>

<p><i>Chloride of lime</i> is a compound of <i>lime and
chlorine</i>. It furnishes both of these constituents to
plants, and it is an excellent absorbent of ammonia<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
and other gases arising from decomposition&mdash;hence
its usefulness in destroying bad odors, and in preserving
fertilizing matters for the use of crops.</p>

<p>It may be used like plaster, or in the decomposition
of organic matters, where it not only hastens
decay, but absorbs and retains the escaping gases.
It will be recollected that <i>chloride of lime</i> is one of
the products of the <i>lime and salt mixture</i>.</p>

<p><i>Lime</i> in combination with <i>phosphoric acid</i> forms
the valuable <i>phosphate of lime</i>, of which so large a
portion of the ash of grain, and the bones of animals,
is formed. This will be spoken of more at length
under the head of 'phosphoric acid.'</p>


<h3 class="gap2">MAGNESIA.</h3>

<p>Magnesia is a constituent of vegetable ashes, and
is almost always present in the soil in sufficient
quantities. When analysis indicates that it is
needed, it may be applied in the form of <i>magnesian
lime</i>, or <i>refuse epsom salts</i>, which are composed of
sulphuric acid and magnesia (sulphate of magnesia).</p>

<p>The great care necessary concerning the use of
magnesia is, not to apply too much of it, it being,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
when in excess, as has been previously remarked, injurious
to the fertility of the soil. Some soils are
hopelessly barren from the fact that they contain too
much magnesia.</p>


<h3 class="gap2">ACIDS.</h3>

<h3 class="gap2">SULPHURIC ACID.</h3>

<div class="sidenote"><p>What is sulphuric acid commonly called?</p>

<p>How may it be used?</p>

<p>How does it prevent the escape of ammonia?</p></div>

<p><i>Sulphuric acid</i> is a very important constituent
of vegetable ashes, especially of oats and the root-crops.</p>

<p>It is often deficient in the soil, particularly where
potatoes have been long cultivated. One of the
reasons why <i>plaster</i> (sulphate of lime) is so beneficial
to the potato crop is undoubtedly that it supplies it
with sulphuric acid.</p>

<p>Sulphuric acid is commonly known by the name
of <i>oil vitriol</i>, and may be purchased for agricultural
purposes at a low price. It may be used in a very
dilute form (weakened by mixing it with a large
quantity of water) to the compost heap, where it
will change the ammonia to a sulphate as soon as
formed, and thus prevent its loss, as the sulphate of
ammonia is not volatile; and, being soluble in water,
is useful to plants. Some idea of the value of this
compound may be formed from the fact that manufac<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>turers
of manures are willing to pay seven cents per
lb., or even more, for sulphate of ammonia, to insure
the success of their fertilizers. Notwithstanding this,
many farmers persist in throwing away hundreds of
pounds of <i>ammonia</i> every year, as a tax for their ignorance
(or indolence), while a small tax in <i>money</i>&mdash;not
more valuable, nor more necessary to their success&mdash;for
the support of common schools, and the better education
of the young, is too often unwillingly paid.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>What is the effect of using too much sulphuric acid?</p></div>

<p>If a tumbler full of sulphuric acid (costing a
few cents), be thrown into the tank of the compost
heap once a month, the benefit to the manure would
be very great.</p>

<p>Where a deficiency of sulphuric acid in the soil
is indicated by analysis, it may be supplied in this
way, or by the use of plaster or refuse epsom salts.</p>

<p>Care is necessary that <i>too much</i> sulphuric acid
be not used, as it would prevent the proper decomposition
of manures, and would induce a growth of
sorrel in the soil by making it <i>sour</i>.</p>

<p>In many instances, it will be found profitable to
use sulphuric acid in the manufacture of super-phosphate
of lime (as directed under the head of 'phosphoric
acid,') thus making it perform the double
purpose of preparing an available form of phosphate,
and of supplying sulphur and sulphuric acid to the
plant.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>


<h3 class="gap2">PHOSPHORIC ACID.</h3>

<div class="sidenote"><p>How large a part of the ashes of grain consists of phosphoric
acid?</p>

<p>Of what other substances does it form a leading ingredient?</p>

<p>How many pounds of sulphuric acid are contained in one hundred
bushels of wheat?</p></div>

<p>We come now to the consideration of one of the
most important of all subjects connected with agriculture,
that is, <i>phosphoric acid</i>.</p>

<p><i>Phosphoric acid</i>, forming about one half of the
ashes of wheat, rye, corn, buckwheat, and oats;
nearly the same proportion of those of barley, peas,
beans and linseed; an important ingredient of the ashes
of potatoes and turnips; one quarter of the ash of
milk and a large proportion of the bones of animals,
often exists in the soil in the proportion of only about
one or two pounds in a thousand. The cultivation
of our whole country has been such, as to take away
the phosphoric acid from the soil without returning
it, except in very minute quantities. Every hundred
bushels of wheat sold contains (and removes permanently
from the soil) about <i>sixty pounds</i> of phosphoric
acid. Other grains, as well as the root crops and
grasses, remove likewise a large quantity of it. It has
been said by a contemporary writer, that for each
cow kept on a pasture through the summer, there is
carried off in veal, butter and cheese, not less than <i>fifty</i>
lbs. of phosphate of lime (bone-earth) on an average.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
This would be <i>one thousand lbs.</i> for twenty cows;
and it shows clearly why old dairy pastures become
so exhausted of this substance, that they will no
longer produce those nutritious grasses, which are
favorable to butter and cheese-making.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>How much phosphate of lime will twenty cows remove from a
pasture during a summer?</p>

<p>What has this removal of phosphate of lime occasioned?</p>

<p>How have the Genesee and Mohawk valleys been affected by
this removal of phosphoric acid?</p></div>

<p>That this removal of the most valuable constituent
of the soil, has been the cause of more exhaustion
of farms, and more emigration, in search
of fertile districts, than any other single effect of
injudicious farming, is a fact which multiplied instances
most clearly prove.</p>

<p>It is stated that the Genesee and Mohawk
valleys, which once produced an average of <i>thirty-five</i>
or <i>forty bushels</i> of wheat, per acre, have since
been reduced in their average production to <i>twelve
and a half</i> bushels. Hundreds of similar cases
might be stated; and in a large majority of these,
could the cause of the impoverishment be ascertained,
it would be found to be the removal of the phosphoric
acid from the soil.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>How may this devastation be arrested?</p>

<p>Is any soil inexhaustible?</p>

<p>What is usually the best source from which to obtain phosphoric
acid?</p></div>

<p>The evident tendency of cultivation being to
continue this murderous system, and to prey upon
the vital strength of the country, it is necessary to
take such measures as will arrest the outflow of this
valuable material. This can never be fully accomplished
until laws shall be made preventing the wastes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
of cities and towns. Such laws have existed for a
long time in China, and have doubtlessly been the
secret of the long subsistence and present prosperity
of the millions of people inhabiting that country.</p>

<p>We have, nevertheless, a means of restoring to
fertility many of our worn-out lands, and preserving
our fertile fields from so rapid impoverishment as
they are now suffering. Many suppose that soils
which produce good crops, year after year, are inexhaustible,
but time will prove to the contrary. They
may possess a sufficiently large stock of phosphoric
acid, and other constituents of plants, to last a long
time, but when that stock becomes so reduced, that
there is not enough left for the uses of full crops, the
productive power of the soil will yearly decrease, until
it becomes worthless. It may last a long time,
a century, or even more, but as long as the system
is&mdash;to <i>remove every thing, and return nothing</i>,&mdash;the
fate of the most fertile soil is evident.</p>

<p>The source mentioned, from which to obtain
phosphoric acid, is the bones of animals. These
contain large quantities of <i>phosphate of lime</i>. They
are the receptacles which collect nearly all of the
phosphates in crops, which are fed to animals, and
are not returned in their excrements. For the grain,
etc., sent out of the country, there is no way to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
repaid except by the importation of this material;

<h3 class="gap2">BONES.</h3>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Of what do dried bones consist?</p>

<p>What is the organic matter of bones?</p>

<p>The inorganic?</p>

<p>What can you say of the use of whole bones?</p></div>

<p><i>Bones</i> consist, when dried, of about one third organic
matter, and two thirds inorganic matter.</p>

<p>The organic matter consists chiefly of <i>gelatine</i>&mdash;a
compound containing <i>nitrogen</i>.</p>

<p>The inorganic part is chiefly <i>phosphate of lime</i>.</p>

<p>Hence, we see that bones are excellent, as both
organic and mineral manure. The organic part,
containing nitrogen, forms <i>ammonia</i>, and the inorganic
part supplies the much needed <i>phosphoric acid</i>
to the soil.</p>

<p>Liebig says that, as a producer of ammonia, 100
lbs. of dry bones are equivalent to 250 lbs. of human
urine.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>How does the value of bone dust compare with that of broken
bones?</p>

<p>What is the reason of the superiority of bone dust?</p>

<p>How is bone-black made?</p>

<p>Of what does it consist?</p></div>

<p>Bones are applied to the soil in almost every conceivable
form. <i>Whole bones</i> are often used in very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
large quantities; their action, however, is extremely
slow, and it is never advisable to use bones in this
form.</p>

<p>Ten bushels of bones, finely ground, will produce
larger results, during the current ten years after application,
than would ensue from the use of one
hundred bushels merely broken, not because the dust
contains more fertilizing matter than the whole
bones, but because that which it does contain is in a
much more available condition. It ferments readily,
and produces ammonia, while the ashy parts are exposed
to the action of roots.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Should farmers burn bones before using them?</p>

<p>How would you compost bones with ashes?</p>

<p>In what way would you prevent the escape of ammonia?</p></div>

<p><i>Bone-black.</i> If bones are burned in retorts, or
otherwise protected from the atmosphere, their organic
matter will all be driven off, except the carbon,
which not being supplied with oxygen cannot escape.
In this form bones are called <i>ivory black</i>, or <i>bone-black</i>.
It consists of the inorganic matter, and the
carbon of the bones. The nitrogen having been expelled
it can make no ammonia, and thus far the
original value of bones is reduced by burning; that
is, one ton of bones contains more fertilizing matter
before, than after burning; but one ton of bone
black is more valuable than one ton of raw bones,
as the carbon is retained in a good form to act as an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
absorbent in the soil, while the whole may be crushed
or ground much more easily than before being
burned. This means of pulverizing bones is adopted
by manufacturers, who replace the ammonia in the
form of guano, or otherwise; but it is not to be recommended
for the use of farmers, who should not
lose the ammonia, forming a part of bones, more than
that of other manure.</p>

<p><i>Composting bones with ashes</i> is a good means of
securing their decomposition. They should be placed
in a water-tight vessel (such as a cask); first, three
or four inches of bones, then the same quantity of
strong unleached wood ashes, continuing these alternate
layers until the cask is full, and keeping them
<i>always wet</i>. If they become too dry they will throw
off an offensive odor, accompanied by the escape of
ammonia, and consequent loss of value. In about
one year, the whole mass of bones (except, perhaps,
those at the top) will be softened, so that they may
be easily crushed, and they are in a good condition
for manuring. The ashes are, in themselves, valuable,
and this compost is excellent for many crops,
particularly for Indian corn. A little dilute sulphuric
acid, occasionally sprinkled on the upper part
of the matter in the cask, will prevent the escape of
the ammonia.</p>

<p>How is super-phosphate of lime made?</p>

<p>Describe the composition of phosphate of lime, and the chemical
changes which take place in altering it to super-phosphate of lime.</p></div>

<p><i>Boiling bones under pressure</i>, whereby their gela<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>tine
is dissolved away, and the inorganic matter left
in an available condition, from its softness, is a very
good way of rendering them useful; but, as it requires,
among other things, a steam boiler, it is
hardly probable that it will be largely adopted by
farmers of limited means.</p>

<p>Any or all of these methods are good, but bones
cannot be used with true economy, except by changing
their inorganic matter into</p>


<h3 class="gap2">SUPER-PHOSPHATE OF LIME.</h3>

<p><i>Super-phosphate of lime</i> is made by treating
phosphate of lime, or the ashes of bones, with <i>sulphuric
acid</i>.</p>

<p>Phosphate of lime, as it exists in bones, consists
of one atom of phosphoric acid and three atoms of
lime. It may be represented as</p>

<p>By adding a proper quantity of sulphuric acid
with this, it becomes <i>super</i>-phosphate of lime; that
is, the same amount of phosphoric acid, with a
smaller proportion of lime (or a <i>super</i>-abundance of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
phosphoric acid), the sulphuric acid, taking two
atoms of lime away from the compound, combined
with it making sulphate of lime (plaster). The
changes may be thus represented.</p>

<p>Super-phosphate of lime may be made from whole
bones, bone dust, bone-black, or from the pure ashes
of bones.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>How should sulphuric acid be applied to whole bones?</p>

<p>What is the necessity for so large an amount of water?</p></div>

<p>The process of making it from whole bones is
slow and troublesome, as it requires a long time for
the effect to diffuse itself through the whole mass of
a large bone. When it is made in this way, the
bones should be <i>dry</i>, and the acid should be diluted
in many times its bulk of water, and should be applied
to the bones (which may be placed in a suitable
cask, with a spiggot at the bottom), in quantities
sufficient to cover them, about once in ten
days; and at the end of that time, one half of the
liquid should be drawn off by the spiggot. This
liquid is a solution of super-phosphate of lime, containing
sulphate of lime, and may be applied to the
soil in a liquid form, or through the medium of a
compost heap. The object of using so much water
is to prevent an incrustation of sulphate of lime on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
the surfaces of the bones, this must be removed
by stirring the mass, which allows the next application
of acid to act directly on the phosphate remaining.
The amount of acid required is about 50 or
60 lbs. to each 100 lbs. of bones. The gelatine will
remain after the phosphate is all dissolved, and may
be composted with muck, or plowed under the soil,
where it will form ammonia.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>May less water be employed in making super-phosphate from
bone dust or crushed bones?</p></div>

<p><i>Bone dust</i>, or <i>crushed bones</i>, may be much more
easily changed to the desired condition, as the surface
exposed is much greater, and the acid can act more
generally throughout the whole mass. The amount
of acid required is the same as in the other case, but
it may be used <i>stronger</i>, two or three times its bulk
of water being sufficient, if the bones are finely
ground or crushed&mdash;more or less water should be
used according to the fineness of the bones. The time
occupied will also be much less, and the result of the
operation will be in better condition for manure.</p>

<p>Bones may be made fine enough for this operation,
either by grinding, etc., or by boiling under pressure,
as previously described; indeed, by whatever method
bones are pulverized, they should always be treated
with sulphuric acid before being applied to the soil,
as this will more than double their value for immediate
use.</p>

<p>Bone-black is chiefly used by manufacturers of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
super-phosphate of lime, who treat it with acid the
same as has been directed above, only that they
grind the black very finely before applying the
acid.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>What other forms of bones may be used in making super-phosphate
of lime?</p>

<p>Why is super-phosphate of lime a better fertilizer than phosphate
of lime?</p>

<p>What can you say of the <i>lasting manures</i>?</p></div>

<p><i>Bone ashes</i>, or bones burned to whiteness, may be
similarly treated. Indeed, in all of the forms of
bones here described, the phosphate of lime remains
unaltered, as it is indestructible by heat; the differences
of composition are only in the admixture of
organic constituents.</p>

<p><i>The reason why super-phosphate of lime is so
much better than phosphate</i>, may be easily explained.
The <i>phosphate</i> is very <i>slowly</i> soluble in water,
and consequently furnishes food to plants slowly.
A piece of bone as large as a pea may lie in the soil
for years without being all consumed; consequently,
it will be years before its value is returned, and it
pays no interest on its cost while lying there. The
<i>super-phosphate</i> dissolves very <i>rapidly</i> and furnishes
food for plants with equal facility; hence its much
greater value as a manure.</p>

<p>It is true that the <i>phosphate</i> is the most <i>lasting</i>
manure; but, once for all, let us caution farmers
against considering this a virtue in mineral manures,
or in organic manures either, when used on soils con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>taining
the proper absorbents of ammonia. They
are <i>lasting</i>, only in proportion as they are <i>lazy</i>.
Manures are worthless unless they are in condition to
be immediately used. The farmer who wishes his
manures to <i>last</i> in the soil, and to lose their use, may
be justly compared with the <i>miser</i>, who buries his
gold and silver in the ground for the satisfaction of
knowing that he owns it. It is an old and a true
saying that "a nimble sixpence is better than a slow
shilling."</p>


<h3 class="gap2">IMPROVED SUPER-PHOSPHATE OF LIME.</h3>

<div class="sidenote"><p>What are the ingredients of the <i>improved</i> super-phosphate of
lime?</p></div>

<p>To show the manner in which super-phosphate
of lime is perfected, and rendered the best manure
for general uses, which has yet been made, containing
large quantities of phosphoric acid and a good
supply of ammonia,&mdash;hereby covering the two leading
deficiencies in a majority of soils, it may be well
to explain the composition of the <i>improved super-phosphate
of lime</i> invented by Prof. Mapes.</p>

<p>This manure consists of the following ingredients
in the proportions named:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Explain the uses of these different constituents.</p>

<p>What is nitrogenized phosphate?</p></div>

<p>The sulphuric acid has the before-mentioned
effect on the bone-black, and <i>fixes</i> the ammonia of
the guano by changing it to a sulphate. The twenty
pounds of sulphate of ammonia added increase the
amount, so as to furnish nitrogen to plants in sufficient
quantities to give them energy, and induce
them to take up the super-phosphate of lime in the
manure more readily than would be done, were there
not a sufficient supply of ammonia in the soil.</p>

<p>The addition of the guano, which contains all of
the elements of fertility, and many of them in considerable
quantities, renders the manure of a more
general character, and enables it to produce very
large crops of almost any kind, while it assists in
fortifying the soil in what is usually its weakest
point&mdash;phosphoric acid.</p>

<p>Prof. Mapes has more recently invented a new
fertilizer called nitrogenized super-phosphate of lime,
composed of the improved super-phosphate of lime
and blood, dried and ground before mixture, in equal
proportions. This manure, from its highly nitrogenous
character, theoretically surpasses all others,
and probably will be found in practice to have great
value; its cost will be rather greater than guano.</p>

<p>We understand its manufacture will shortly be
commenced by a company now forming for that
purpose.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>What should be learned before purchasing amendments for the
soil?</p>

<p>What do you know of silica?</p></div>

<p>Many farmers will find it expedient to purchase
bones, or bone dust, and manufacture their own
super-phosphate of lime; others will prefer to purchase
the prepared manure. In doing so, it should
be obtained of men of known respectability, as manures
are easily adulterated with worthless matters;
and, as their price is so high, that such deception
may occasion great loss.</p>

<p>We would not recommend the application of any
artificial manure, without first obtaining an analysis
of the soil, and knowing <i>to a certainty</i> that the manure
is needed; still, when no analysis has been procured,
it may be profitable to apply such manures
as most generally produce good results&mdash;such as
stable manure, night soil, the improved super-phosphate
of lime; or, if this cannot be procured,
guano.</p>


<h3 class="gap2">NEUTRALS.</h3>

<h3 class="gap2">SILICA.</h3>

<p><i>Silica</i> (or sand) always exists in the soil in sufficient
quantities for the supply of food for plants; but,
as has been often stated in the preceding pages, not
always in the proper condition. This subject has
been so often explained to the student of this book,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
that it is only necessary to repeat here, that when the
weakness of the straw or stalk of plants grown on
any soil indicates an inability in that soil to supply
the silicates required for strength, not more sand
should be added, but <i>alkalies</i>, to combine with the
sand already contained in it, and make <i>soluble silicates</i>
which are available to roots.</p>

<p>Sand is often necessary to stiff clays, as a <i>mechanical</i>
manure, to loosen their texture and render
them easier of cultivation, and more favorable to the
distribution of roots, and to the circulation of air
and water.</p>


<h3 class="gap2">CHLORINE.</h3>

<div class="sidenote"><p>How may chlorine be applied?</p></div>

<p><i>Chlorine</i>, a necessary constituent of plants, and
often deficient in the soil (as indicated by analysis),
may be applied in the form of salt (chloride of
sodium), or chloride of lime. The former may be
dissolved in the water used to slake lime, and the
latter may, with much advantage, be sprinkled around
stables and other places where fertilizing gases are
escaping, and, after being saturated with ammonia,
applied to the soil, thus serving a double purpose.</p>


<h3 class="gap2">OXIDE OF IRON.</h3>

<div class="sidenote"><p>How may the protoxide of iron be changed to peroxide?</p></div>

<p>Nearly all soils contain sufficient quantities of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
<i>oxide of iron</i>, or iron rust, so that this substance can
hardly be required as a manure.</p>

<p>Some soils, however, contain the <i>prot</i>oxide of
iron in such quantities as to be injurious to plants,&mdash;see
page <a href="#Page_86">86</a>. When this is the case, it is necessary
to plow the soil thoroughly, and use such other
mechanical means as shall render it open to the admission
of air. The <i>prot</i>oxide of iron will then take
up more oxygen, and become the <i>per</i>oxide&mdash;which
is not only inoffensive, but is absolutely necessary to
fertility.</p>

<p>This can hardly be called an essential constituent

<h3 class="gap2">VARIOUS OTHER MINERAL MANURES.</h3>

<h3 class="gap2">LEACHED ASHES.</h3>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Why are leached ashes inferior to those that have not been
leached?</p>

<p>On what do the benefits of leached ashes depend?</p>

<p>Can these ingredients be more cheaply obtained in another
form?</p>

<p>Why do unleached ashes, applied in the spring, sometimes cause
grain to lodge?</p></div>

<p>Among the mineral manures which have not yet
been mentioned&mdash;not coming strictly under any of
the preceding heads, is the one known as <i>leached
ashes</i>.</p>

<p>These are not without their benefits, though
worth much less than unleached ashes, which, be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>sides
the constituents of those which have been
leached, contain much potash, soda, etc.</p>

<p>Farmers have generally overrated the value of
leached ashes, because they contain small quantities
of available phosphate of lime, and soluble silicates,
in which most old soils are deficient. While
we witness the good results ensuing from their application,
we should not forget that the fertilizing
ingredients of <i>thirty bushels</i> of these ashes may be
bought in a more convenient form for <i>ten</i> or <i>fifteen
cents</i>, or for less than the cost of spreading the ashes
on the soil. In many parts of Long Island farmers
pay as much as eight or ten cents per bushel for this
manure, and thousands of loads of leached ashes are
taken to this locality from the river counties of New
York, and even from the State of Maine, and are sold
for many times their value, producing an effect which
could be as well and much more cheaply obtained by
the use of small quantities of super-phosphate of lime
and potash.</p>

<p>These ashes often contain a little charcoal (resulting
from the imperfect combustion of the wood),
which acts as an absorbent of ammonia.</p>

<p>It is sometimes observed that <i>unleached</i> ashes,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
when applied in the spring, cause grain to lodge.
When this is the case, as it seldom is, it may be inferred
that the potash which they contain causes so
rapid a growth, that the soil is not able to supply
silicates as fast as they are required by the plants,
but after the first year, the potash will have united
with the silica in the soil, and overcome the difficulty.</p>


<h3 class="gap2">OLD MORTAR.</h3>

<div class="sidenote"><p>What are the most fertilizing ingredients of old mortar?</p></div>

<p><i>Old mortar</i> is a valuable manure, because it contains
nitrate of potash and other compounds of nitric
acid with alkalies.</p>

<p>These are slowly formed in the mortar by the
changing of the nitrogen of the hair (in the mortar)
into nitric acid, and the union of this with the small
quantities of <i>potash</i>, or with the <i>lime</i> of the plaster.
Nitrogen, presented in other forms, as ammonia, for
instance, may be transformed into nitric acid, by
uniting with the oxygen of the air, and this nitric
acid combines immediately with the alkalies of the
mortar.<a name="FNanchor_AI_35" id="FNanchor_AI_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_AI_35" class="fnanchor">[AI]</a></p>

<p>The lime contained in the mortar may be useful
in the soil for the many purposes accomplished by
other lime.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>


<h3 class="gap2">GAS HOUSE LIME.</h3>

<div class="sidenote"><p>How may gas-house lime be prepared for use?</p>

<p>Why should it not be used fresh, from the gas house?</p>

<p>On what do its fertilizing properties depend?</p>

<p>What use may be made of its offensive odor?</p></div>

<p><i>The refuse lime of gas works</i>, where it can be
cheaply obtained, may be advantageously used as a
manure. It consists, chiefly, of various compounds
of sulphur and lime. It should be composted with
earth or refuse matter, so as to expose it to the action
of air. It should never be used fresh from
the gas house. In a few months the sulphur will
have united with the oxygen of the air, and become
sulphuric acid, which unites with the lime and makes
sulphate of lime (plaster), which form it must assume,
before it is of much value. Having been
used to purify gas made from coal, it contains a
small quantity of ammonia, which adds to its value.
It is considered a profitable manure in England, at
the price there paid for it (forty cents a cartload),
and, if of good quality, it may be worth double that
sum, especially for soils deficient in plaster, or for
such crops as are much benefited by plaster. Its
price must, of course, be regulated somewhat by the
price of lime, which constitutes a large proportion
of its fertilizing parts. The offensive odor of this
compound renders it a good protection against many
insects.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

<p>The refuse <i>liquor of gas works</i> contains enough
ammonia to make it a valuable manure.</p>


<h3 class="gap2">SOAPERS' LEY AND BLEACHERS' LEY.</h3>

<div class="sidenote"><p>What use may be made of the refuse ley of soap-makers and
bleachers?</p>

<p>What peculiar qualities does soapers' ley possess?</p></div>

<p>The refuse ley of soap factories and bleaching establishments
contains greater or less quantities of soluble
silicates and alkalies (especially soda and potash),
and is a good addition to the tank of the compost
heap, or it may be used directly as a liquid application
to the soil. The soapers' ley, especially, will be
found a good manure for lands on which grain lodges.</p>

<p>Much of the benefit of this manure arises from
the soluble silicates it contains, while its nitrogenous
matter,<a name="FNanchor_AJ_36" id="FNanchor_AJ_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_AJ_36" class="fnanchor">[AJ]</a> obtained from those parts of the fatty matters
which cannot be converted into soap, and consequently
remains in this solution, forms a valuable
addition. Heaps of soil saturated with this liquid
in autumn, and subjected to the freezings of winter,
form an admirable manure for spring use. Mr.
Crane, near Newark (N. J.), has long used a mixture
of spent ley and stable manure, applied in the
fall to trenches plowed in the soil, and has been most
successful in obtaining large crops.</p>

<h3 class="gap2">IRRIGATION.</h3>

<div class="sidenote"><p>On what does the benefit arising from irrigation chiefly depend?</p>

<p>What kind of water is best for irrigation?</p>

<p>How do under-drains increase the benefits of irrigation?</p></div>

<p><i>Irrigation</i> does not come strictly under the head
of inorganic manures, as it often supplies ammonia
to the soil. Its chief value, however, in most cases,
must depend on the amount of mineral matter which
it furnishes.</p>

<p>The word "irrigation" means simply <i>watering</i>.
In many districts water is in various ways made to
overflow the land, and is removed when necessary for
the purposes of cultivation. All river and spring
water contains some impurities, many of which are
beneficial to vegetation. These are derived from the
earth over, or through which, the water has passed,
and ammonia absorbed from the atmosphere. When
water is made to cover the earth, especially if its rapid
motion be arrested, much of this fertilizing matter
settles, and is deposited on the soil. The water
which sinks into the soil carries its impurities to be
retained for the uses of plants. When, by the aid
of under-drains, or in open soils, the water passes
<i>through</i> the soil, its impurities are arrested, and become
available in vegetable growth. It is, of course,
impossible to say exactly what kind of mineral matter
is supplied by water, as that depends on the kind
of rock or soil from which the impurities are derived;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
but, whatever it may be, it is generally soluble and
ready for immediate use by plants.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>What is the difference between water which only runs over the
surface of the earth, and that which runs out of the earth?</p>

<p>Why should strong currents of water not be allowed to traverse
the soil?</p></div>

<p>Water which has run over the surface of the
earth contains both ammonia and mineral matter,
while that which has arisen out of the earth, contains
usually only mineral matter. The direct use
of the water of irrigation as a solvent for the mineral
ingredients of the soil, is one of its main benefits.</p>

<p>To describe the many modes of irrigation would
be too long a task for our limited space. It may be
applied in any way in which it is possible to cover
the land with water, at stated times. Care is necessary,
however, that it do not wash more fertilizing
matter from the soil than it deposits on it, as would
often be the case, if a strong current of water were
run over it. Brooks may be dammed up, and thus
made to cover a large quantity of land. In such
a case the rapid current would be destroyed, and the
fertilizing matter would settle; but, if the course
of the brook were turned, so that it would run in a
current over any part of the soil, it might carry away
more than it deposited, and thus prove injurious.
Small streams turned on to land, from the washing
of roads, or from elevated springs, are good means
of irrigation, and produce increased fertility, except<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
where the soil is of such a character as to prevent
the water from passing away, in which case it should
be under-drained.</p>

<p>Irrigation was one of the oldest means of fertility
ever used by man, and still continues in great
favor wherever its effects have been witnessed.</p>


<h3 class="gap2">MIXING SOILS.</h3>

<div class="sidenote"><p>How are soils improved by mixing?</p></div>

<p>The <i>mixing of soils</i> is often all that is necessary
to render them fertile, and to improve their <i>mechanical</i>
condition. For instance, soils deficient in potash,
or any other constituent, may have that deficiency
supplied, by mixing with them soil containing
this constituent in excess.</p>

<p>It is very frequently the case, that such means of
improvement are easily availed of. While these
chemical effects are being produced, there may be
an equal improvement in the mechanical character
of the soil. Thus stiff clay soils are rendered lighter,
and more easily workable, by an admixture of
sand, while light blowy sands are compacted, and
made more retentive of manure, by a dressing of
clay or of muck.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Why may the same effect sometimes be produced by deep
plowing?</p>

<p>What is absolutely necessary to economical manuring?</p></div>

<p>Of course, this cannot be depended on as a sure
means of chemical improvement, unless the soils are
previously analyzed, so as to know their require<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>ments;
but, in a majority of cases, the soil will be
benefited, by mixing with it soil of a different character.
It is not always necessary to go to other
locations to procure the soil to be applied, as the
subsoil is often very different from the surface soil,
and simple deep plowing will suffice, in such cases,
to produce the required admixture, by bringing up the
earth from below to mingle it with that of a different
character at the surface.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>In the foregoing remarks on the subject of mineral
manures, the writer has endeavored to point out
such a course as would produce the "greatest good
to the greatest number," and, consequently, has
neglected much which might discourage the farmer
with the idea, that the whole system of scientific
agriculture is too expensive for his adoption. Still,
while he has confined his remarks to the more simple
improvements on the present system of management,
he would say, briefly, that <i>no manuring can be
strictly economical that is not based on an analysis
of the soil, and a knowledge of the best means of
overcoming the deficiencies indicated, together with the
most scrupulous care of every ounce of evaporating
or soluble manure</i>.</p>

<h3>ATMOSPHERIC FERTILIZERS.</h3>


<div class="sidenote"><p>Are the gases in the atmosphere manures?</p>

<p>What would be the result if they were not so?</p></div>

<p>It is not common to look on the gases in the atmosphere
in the light of manures, but they are decidedly
so. Indeed, they are almost the only organic manure
ever received by the uncultivated parts of the
earth, as well as a large portion of that which is occupied
in the production of food for man.</p>

<p>If these gases were not manures; if there were
no means by which they could be used by plants, the
fertility of the soil would long since have ceased, and
the earth would now be in an unfertile condition.
That this must be true, will be proved by a few moments'
reflection on the facts stated in the first part
of this book. The fertilizing gases in the atmosphere
being composed of the constituents of decayed
plants and animals, it is as necessary that they should
be again returned to the form of organized matter,
as it is that constituents taken from the <i>soil</i> should
not be put out of existence.</p>


<h3 class="gap2">AMMONIA.</h3>

<div class="sidenote"><p>How is ammonia used by plants?</p>

<p>How may it be carried to the soil?</p>

<p>How may the value of organic manures be estimated?</p>

<p>What effects has ammonia beside supplying food to plants?</p></div>

<p>The <i>ammonia</i> in the atmosphere probably cannot
be appropriated by the leaves of plants, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
must, therefore, enter the soil to be assimilated by
roots. It reaches the soil in two ways. It is either
arrested from the air circulating through the soil, or
it is absorbed by rains in the atmosphere, and thus
carried to the earth, where it is retained by clay
and carbon, for the uses of plants. In the soil,
ammonia is the most important of all organic
manures. In fact, the value of organic manure
may be estimated, either by the amount of ammonia
which it will yield, or by its power of absorbing
ammonia from other sources.</p>

<p>The most important action of ammonia in the
soil is the supply of <i>nitrogen</i> to plants; but it has
other offices which are of consequence. It assists in
some of the chemical changes necessary to prepare
the matters in the soil for assimilation. Some argue
that ammonia <i>stimulates</i> the roots of plants, and
causes them to take up increased quantities of inorganic
matter. The discussion of this question would
be out of place here, and we will simply say, that it
gives them such vigor that they require increased
amounts of ashy matter, and enables them to take
this from the soil.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>To how great a degree can the farmer control atmospheric fertilizers?</p>

<p>What should be the condition of the soil?</p>

<p>What substances are good absorbents in the soil?</p>

<p>How may sandy soils be made retentive of ammonia?</p></div>

<p>Although, in the course of nature, the atmospheric
fertilizers are plentifully supplied to the soil,
without the immediate attention of the farmer, it is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
not beyond his power to manage them in such a
manner as to arrest a greater quantity. The precautions
necessary have been repeatedly given in the
preceding pages, but it may be well to name them
again in this chapter.</p>

<p>The condition of the soil is the main point to be
considered. It must be such as to absorb and retain
ammonia&mdash;to allow water to pass <i>through</i> it, and be
discharged <i>below</i> the point to which the roots of
crops are searching for food&mdash;and to admit of a free
circulation of air.</p>

<p>The power of absorbing and retaining ammonia
is not possessed by sand, but it is a prominent property
of clay, charcoal, and some other matters
named as absorbents. Hence, if the soil consists of
nearly pure sand, it will not make use of the ammonia
brought to it from the atmosphere, but will allow
it to evaporate immediately after a shower. Soils in
this condition require additions of absorbent matters,
to enable them to use the ammonia received from
the atmosphere. Soils already containing a sufficient
amount of clay or charcoal, are thus far prepared to
receive benefit from this source.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Why does under-draining increase the absorptive power of the
soil?</p>

<p>How do plants obtain their carbonic acid?</p>

<p>How does carbonic acid affect caustic lime in the soil?</p></div>

<p>The next point is to cause the water of rains to
pass <i>through</i> the soil. If it lies on the surface, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
runs off without entering the soil, or even if it only
enters to a slight depth, and comes in contact with
but a small quantity of the absorbents, it is not probable
that the fertilizing matters which it contains
will all be abstracted. Some of them will undoubtedly
return to the atmosphere on the evaporation of
the water; but, if the soil contains a sufficient
supply of absorbents, and will allow all rain water to
pass through it, the fertilizing gases will all be retained.
They will be filtered (or raked) out of the
water.</p>

<p>This subject will be more fully treated in <a href="#SECTION_FOURTH">Section
IV.</a> in connection with under-draining.</p>

<p>Besides the properties just described, the soil
must possess the power of admitting a free circulation
of air. To effect this, it is necessary that the soil
should be well pulverized to a great depth. If, in
addition to this, the soil be such as to admit water
to pass through, it will allow that circulation of air
necessary to the greatest supply of ammonia.</p>


<h3 class="gap2">CARBONIC ACID.</h3>

<div class="sidenote"><p>What power does it give to water?</p>

<p>What condition of the soil is necessary for the reception of the
largest quantity of carbonic acid?</p>

<p>May oxygen be considered a manure?</p>

<p>What is the effect of the oxidation of the constituents of the
soil?</p></div>

<p>Carbonic acid is received from the atmosphere,
both by the leaves and roots of plants.</p>

<p>If there is caustic lime in the soil, it unites with
it, and makes it milder and finer. It is absorbed by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
the water in the soil, and gives it the power of dissolving
many more substances than it would do without
the carbonic acid. This use is one of very great importance,
as it is equivalent to making the minerals
themselves more soluble. Water dissolves carbonate
of lime, etc., exactly in proportion to the
amount of carbonic acid which it contains. We
should, therefore, strive to have as much carbonic
acid as possible in the water in the soil; and one
way, in which to effect this, is to admit to the soil
the largest possible quantity of atmospheric air which
contains this gas.</p>

<p>The condition of soil necessary for this, is the
same as is required for the deposit of ammonia by
the same circulation of air.</p>


<h3 class="gap2">OXYGEN.</h3>

<div class="sidenote"><p>How does it affect the protoxide of iron?</p>

<p>How does it neutralize the acids in the soil?</p>

<p>How does it affect its organic parts?</p>

<p>How does it form nitric acid?</p>

<p>How may it affect excrementitious matter of plants?</p>

<p>What effect has it on the mechanical condition of the soil?</p></div>

<p><i>Oxygen</i>, though not taken up by plants in its pure
form, may justly be classed among manures, if we
consider its effects both chemical and mechanical in
the soil.</p>

<p>1. By oxidizing or <i>rusting</i> some of the constituents
of the soil, it prepares them for the uses of
plants.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<p>2. It unites with the <i>prot</i>oxide of iron, and
changes it to the <i>per</i>oxide.</p>

<p>3. If there are <i>acids</i> in the soil, which make it
sour and unfertile, it may be opened to the circulation
of the air, and the oxygen will prepare some of
the mineral matters contained in the soil to unite
with the acids and neutralize them.</p>

<p>4. Oxygen combines with the carbon of organic
matters in the soil, and causes them to decay. The
combination produces carbonic acid.</p>

<p>5. It combines with the nitrogen of decaying substances
and forms <i>nitric acid</i>, which is serviceable as
food for plants.</p>

<p>6. It undoubtedly affects in some way the matter
which is thrown out from the roots of plants. This,
if allowed to accumulate, and remain unchanged, is
often very injurious to plants; but, probably, the
oxygen and carbonic acid of the air in the soil change
it to a form to be inoffensive, or even make it again
useful to the plant.</p>

<p>7. It may also improve the <i>mechanical</i> condition
of the soil, as it causes its particles to crumble, thus
making it finer; and it roughens the surfaces of particles,
making them less easy to move among each
other.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>

<p>These properties of oxygen claim for it a high
place among the atmospheric fertilizers.</p>


<h3 class="gap2">WATER.</h3>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Why may water be considered an atmospheric manure?</p>

<p>What classes of action have manures?</p>

<p>What are chemical manures? Mechanical?</p></div>

<p><i>Water</i> may be considered an atmospheric manure,
as its chief supply to vegetation is received
from the air in the form of rain or dew. Its many
effects are already too well known to need farther
comment.</p>

<p>The means of supplying water to the soil by the
deposit of <i>dew</i> will be fully explained in <a href="#SECTION_FOURTH">Section IV.</a></p>



<h2 class="gap4">CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<h3>RECAPITULATION.</h3>


<p>Manures have two distinct classes of action in the
soil, namely, <i>chemical</i> and <i>mechanical</i>.</p>

<p><i>Chemical</i> manures are those which enter into the
construction of plants, or produce such chemical
effects on matters in the soil as shall prepare them
for use.</p>

<p><i>Mechanical</i> manures are those which improve<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
the mechanical condition of the soil, such as loosening
stiff clays, compacting light sands, pulverizing
large particles, etc.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>What are the three kinds of manures?</p>

<p>What are organic manures, and what are their uses? Mineral?
Atmospheric?</p></div>

<p>Manures are of three distinct kinds, namely, <i>Organic</i>,
<i>mineral</i>, and <i>atmospheric</i>.</p>

<p><i>Organic</i> manures comprise all vegetable and animal
matters (except ashes) which are used to fertilize
the soil. Vegetable manures supply carbonic
acid, and inorganic matter to plants. Animal manures
supply the same substances and ammonia.</p>

<p><i>Mineral</i> manures comprise ashes, salt, phosphate
of lime, plaster, etc. They supply plants with inorganic
matter. Their usefulness depends on their solubility.</p>

<p>Many of the organic and mineral manures have
the power of absorbing ammonia arising from the decomposition
of animal manures, as well as that which
is brought to the soil by rains&mdash;these are called absorbents.</p>

<p><i>Atmospheric</i> manures consist of ammonia, carbonic
acid, oxygen and water. Their greatest usefulness
requires the soil to allow the water of rains to
pass <i>through</i> it, to admit of a free circulation of air
among its particles, and to contain a sufficient
amount of absorbent matter to arrest and retain all
ammonia and carbonic acid presented to it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>What rule should regulate the application of manures?</p>

<p>How must organic manures be managed? Atmospheric?</p></div>

<p>Manures should never be applied to the soil without
regard to its requirements.</p>

<p>Ammonia and carbon are almost always useful,
but mineral manures become mere <i>dirt</i> when applied
to soils not deficient of them.</p>

<p>The only true guide to the exact requirements of
the soil is <i>chemical analysis</i>; and this must always
be obtained before farming can be carried on with true
economy.</p>

<p>Organic manures must be protected against the
escape of their ammonia and the leaching out of their
soluble parts. One cord of stable manure properly
preserved, is worth ten cords which have lost all of
their ammonia by evaporation, and their soluble parts
by leaching&mdash;as is the case with much of the manure
kept exposed in open barn-yards.</p>

<p>Atmospheric manures cost nothing, and are of
great value when properly employed. In consequence
of this, the soil which is enabled to make the
largest appropriation of the atmospheric fertilizers,
is worth many times as much as that which allows
them to escape.</p>

<h2>MECHANICAL CULTIVATION.</h2>



<h2 class="gap4">CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h3>THE MECHANICAL CHARACTER OF
SOILS.</h3>


<div class="sidenote"><p>What is the first office of the soil?</p>

<p>How does it hold water for the uses of the plant?</p>

<p>How does it obtain a part of its moisture?</p></div>

<p>The mechanical character of the soil is well understood
from preceding remarks, and the learner
knows that there are many offices to be performed
by the soil aside from the feeding of plants.</p>

<p>1. It admits the roots of plants, and holds them
in their position.</p>

<p>2. By a sponge-like action, it holds water for
the uses of the plant.</p>

<p>3. It absorbs moisture from the atmosphere to
supply the demands of plants.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>How may it obtain heat?</p>

<p>What is the use of the air circulating among its particles?</p>

<p>Could most soils be brought to the highest state of fertility?</p>

<p>What is the first thing to be done?</p>

<p>Should its color be darkened?</p></div>

<p>4. It absorbs heat from the sun's rays to assist in
the process of growth.</p>

<p>5. It admits air to circulate among roots, and
supply them with a part of their food, while the
oxygen of that air renders available the minerals of
the soil; and its carbonic acid, being absorbed by the
water in the soil, gives it the power of dissolving, and
carrying into roots more inorganic matter than would
be contained in purer water.</p>

<p>6. It allows the excrementitious matter thrown
out by roots to be carried out of their reach.</p>

<p>All of these actions the soil must be capable of
performing, before it can be in its highest state of
fertility. There are comparatively few soils now in
this condition, but there are also few which could not
be profitably rendered so, by a judicious application
of the modes of cultivation to be described in the following
chapters.</p>

<p>The three great objects to be accomplished are:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. To adopt such a system of drainage as will
cause all of the water of rains to pass <i>through</i> the
soil, instead of evaporating from the surface.</p>

<p>2. To pulverize the soil to a considerable depth.</p>

<p>3. To darken its color, and render it capable of
absorbing atmospheric fertilizers.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Name some of the means used to secure these effects.</p>

<p>Why are under-drains superior to open drains?</p></div>

<p>The means used to secure these effects are <i>under-draining,
sub-soil and surface-plowing, digging, applying
muck, etc.</i></p>



<h2 class="gap4">CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3>UNDER-DRAINING.</h3>


<p>The advantages of <i>under</i>-drains over <i>open</i> drains are
very great.</p>

<p>When open drains are used, much water passes
into them immediately from the surface, and carries
with it fertilizing parts of the soil, while their beds
are often compacted by the running water and the
heat of the sun, so that they become water tight,
and do not admit water from the lower parts of the
soil.</p>

<p>The sides of these drains are often covered with
weeds, which spread their seeds throughout the whole
field. Open drains are not only a great obstruction
to the proper cultivation of the land, but they cause
much waste of room, as we can rarely plow nearer
than within six or eight feet of them.</p>

<p>There are none of these objections to the use of
under-drains, as these are completely covered, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
do not at all interfere with the cultivation of the
surface.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>With what materials may under-drains be constructed?</p>

<p>Describe the tile.</p></div>

<p>Under drains may be made with brush, stones,
or tiles. Brush is a very poor material, and its use is
hardly to be recommended. Small stones are better,
and if these be placed in the bottoms of the trenches,
to a depth of eight or ten inches, and covered with
sods turned upside down, having the earth packed
well down on to them, they make very good drains.</p>


<h3 class="gap2">TILE DRAINING.</h3>

<p>The best under-drains are those made with tiles,
or burnt clay pipes. The first form of these used
was that called the <i>horse-shoe tile</i>, which was in
two distinct pieces; this was superseded by a round
pipe, and we have now what is called the <i>sole tile</i>,
which is much better than either of the others.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 603px;">
<img src="images/fig004.png" width="603" height="122" alt="Fig. 4-Sole Tile." title="" />
<span class="caption">Fig. 4&mdash;Sole Tile.</span>
</div>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Why is the sole tile superior to those of previous construction?</p>

<p>How are these tiles laid?</p>

<p>How may the trenches be dug?</p></div>

<p>This tile is made (like the horse-shoe and pipe
tile) of common brick clay, and is burned the same
as bricks. It is about one half or three quarters of
an inch thick, and is so porous that water passes di<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>rectly
through it. It has a flat bottom on which
to stand, and this enables it to retain its position,
while making the drain, better than would
be done by the round pipe. The orifice through
which the water passes is egg-shaped, having its
smallest curve at the bottom. This shape is the one
most easily kept clear, as any particles of dirt which
get into the drain must fall immediately to the point
where even the smallest stream of water runs, and
are thus removed. An orifice of about two inches is
sufficient for the smaller drains, while the main
drains require larger tiles.</p>

<p>These tiles are laid, so that their ends will touch
each other, on the bottoms of the trenches, and are
kept in position by having the earth tightly packed
around them. Care must be taken that no space is
left between the ends of the tiles, as dirt would be
liable to get in and choke the drain. It is advisable
to place a sod&mdash;grass side down&mdash;over each joint,
before filling the trench, as this more effectually protects
them against the entrance of dirt. There is
no danger of keeping the water out by this operation,
as it will readily pass through any part of the tiles.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 163px;">
<span class="caption">Fig. 5.</span>
<img src="images/fig005.png" width="163" height="386" alt="Upton tool. Spade and hoe." title="" />
<p class="caption" style="text-align:left;float:left;">Upton tool.</p>
<p class="caption ralign">Spade and hoe.</p>
</div>

<p>In <i>digging the trenches</i> it is not necessary (except
in very stony ground) to dig out a place wide enough
for a man to stand in, as there are tools made expressly
for the purpose, by which a trench may be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
dug six or seven inches wide, and to any required
depth. One set of these implements consists of a
long narrow spade and a hoe to correspond, such as
are represented in the accompanying figure.</p>

<p>With these tools, and a long
light crowbar, for hard soils,
trenches may be dug much more
cheaply than with the common
spade and pickaxe. Where there
are large boulders in the soil, these
draining tools may dig under them
so that they will not have to be
removed.</p>

<p style="clear:both;">When the trenches are dug to
a sufficient depth, the bottoms
must be made perfectly smooth,
with the required descent (from
six inches to a few feet in one
hundred feet). Then the tiles
may be laid in, so that their ends
will correspond, be packed down,
and the trenches filled up. Such a drain, if properly
constructed, may last for ages. Unlike the stone
drain, it is not liable to be frequented by rats, nor
choked up by the soil working into it.</p>

<p>The position of the tile may be best represented
by a figure, also the mode of constructing stone
drains.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Why are small stones better than large stones in the construction
of drains?</p>

<p>On what must the depth of under-drains depend?</p></div>

<p>It will be seen that the tile
drain is made with much less
labor than the stone drain, as it
requires less digging, while the
breaking up of the stone for
the stone drain will be nearly,

tiles. Drains made with large
stones are not nearly so good as
with small ones, because they are more liable to be
choked up by animals working in them.<a name="FNanchor_AK_37" id="FNanchor_AK_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_AK_37" class="fnanchor">[AK]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Describe the principle which regulates these relative depths
and distances. (Blackboard.)</p>

<p>Which is usually the cheaper plan of constructing drains?</p></div>

<p>The <i>depth</i> of the drains must depend on the distances
at which they are placed. If but <i>twenty</i> feet
apart, they need be but <i>three</i> feet deep; while, if
they are <i>eighty</i> feet apart, they must be <i>five</i> feet
deep, to produce the same effect. The reason for
this is, that the water in the drained soil is not level,
but is higher midway between the drains, than at
any other point. It is necessary that this highest
point should be sufficiently far from the surface not
to interfere with the roots of plants, consequently,
as the water line between two drains is <i>curved</i>, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
most distant drains must be the deepest. This will
be understood by referring to the following diagram.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 655px;">

<p>The curved line represents the position of the
water.</p>

<p>In most soils it will be easier to dig one trench
five feet deep, than four trenches three feet deep,
and the deep trenches will be equally beneficial; but
where the soil is very hard below a depth of three
feet, the shallow trenches will be the cheapest, and
in such soils they will often be better, as the hard
mass might not allow the water to pass down to enter
the deeper drains.</p>

<p>By following out these instructions, land may be
cheaply, thoroughly, and permanently drained.</p>

<h3>ADVANTAGES OF UNDER-DRAINING.</h3>


<p>The advantages of under-draining are many and
important.</p>

<p>1. It entirely prevents drought.</p>

<p>2. It furnishes an increased supply of atmospheric
fertilizers.</p>

<p>3. It warms the lower portions of the soil.</p>

<p>4. It hastens the decomposition of roots and
other organic matter.</p>

<p>5. It accelerates the disintegration of the mineral
matters in the soil.</p>

<p>6. It causes a more even distribution of nutritious
matters among those parts of soil traversed by
roots.</p>

<p>7. It improves the mechanical texture of the
soil.</p>

<p>8. It causes the poisonous excrementitious matter
of plants to be carried out of the reach of their
roots.</p>

<p>9. It prevents grasses from running out.</p>

<p>10. It enables us to deepen the surface soil.</p>

<p>By removing excess of water&mdash;</p>

<p>11. It renders soils earlier in the spring.</p>

<p>12. It prevents the throwing out of grain in
winter.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>

<p>13. It allows us to work sooner after rains.</p>

<p>14. It keeps off the effects of cold weather longer
in the fall.</p>

<p>15. It prevents the formation of <i>acetic</i> and other
organic acids, which induce the growth of sorrel and
similar weeds.</p>

<p>16. It hastens the decay of vegetable matter,
and the finer comminution of the earthy parts of
the soil.</p>

<p>17. It prevents, in a great measure, the evaporation
of water, and the consequent abstraction of
heat from the soil.</p>

<p>18. It admits fresh quantities of water from
rains, etc., which are always more or less imbued
with the fertilizing gases of the atmosphere, to be
deposited among the absorbent parts of soil, and
given up to the necessities of plants.</p>

<p>19. It prevents the formation of so hard a crust
on the surface of the soil as is customary on heavy
lands.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<div class="sidenote"><p>How does under-draining prevent drought?</p></div>

<p>1. Under-draining <i>prevents drought</i>, because it
gives a better circulation of air in the soil; (it does so
by making it more open). There is always the same
amount of water <i>in</i> and <i>about</i> the surface of the
earth. In winter, there is more in the soil than in
summer, while in summer, that which has been dried<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
out of the soil exists in the atmosphere in the form
of a <i>vapor</i>. It is held in the vapory form by <i>heat</i>,
which acts as <i>braces</i> to keep it distended. When
vapor comes in contact with substances sufficiently
colder than itself, it gives up its heat&mdash;thus losing
its braces&mdash;contracts, and becomes liquid water.</p>

<p>This may be observed in hundreds of common
operations.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Why is there less water in the soil in summer than in winter,
and where does it exist?</p>

<p>What holds it in its vapory form?</p>

<p>How is it affected by cold substances?</p>

<p>Describe the deposit of moisture on the outside of a pitcher in
summer.</p>

<p>What other instances of the same action can be named?</p></div>

<p>It is well known that a cold pitcher in summer
robs the vapor in the atmosphere of its heat, and
causes it to be deposited on its own surface. It looks
as though the pitcher were <i>sweating</i>, but the water
all comes from the atmosphere, not, of course, through
the sides of the pitcher.</p>

<p>If we breathe on a knife-blade, it condenses in
the same manner the moisture of the breath, and
becomes covered with a film of water.</p>

<p>Stone houses are damp in summer, because the
inner surfaces of the walls, being cooler than the
atmosphere, cause its moisture to be deposited in the
manner described. By leaving a space, however,
between the walls and the plaster, this moisture is
prevented from being troublesome.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>How does this principle affect the soil?</p>

<p>Explain the experiment with the two boxes of soil.</p></div>

<p>Nearly every night in the summer season, the cold<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
earth receives moisture from the atmosphere in the
form of dew.</p>

<p>A cabbage, which at night is very cold, condenses
water to the amount of a gill or more.</p>

<p>The same operation takes place in the soil. When
the air is allowed to circulate among its lower and
<i>cooler</i> particles, they receive moisture from the same
process of condensation. Therefore, when, by the
aid of under-drains, the lower soil becomes sufficiently
open to admit of a circulation of air, the deposit
of atmospheric moisture will keep the soil supplied
with water at a point easily accessible to the roots
of plants.</p>

<p>If we wish to satisfy ourselves that this is <i>practically</i>
correct, we have only to prepare two boxes of
finely pulverized soil, one, five or six inches deep,
and the other fifteen or twenty inches deep, and
place them in the sun at mid-day in summer. The
thinner soil will be completely dried, while the deeper
one, though it may have been perfectly dry at first,
will soon accumulate a large amount of water on
those particles which, being lower and more sheltered
from the sun's heat than the particles of the thin soil,
are made cooler.</p>

<p>With an open condition of subsoil, then, such as
may be secured by under-draining, we entirely overcome
drought.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>How does under-draining supply to the soil an increased amount
of atmospheric fertilizers?</p>

<p>How does it warm the lower parts of the soil?</p></div>

<p>2. Under-draining <i>furnishes an increased supply
of atmospheric fertilizers</i>, because it secures a change
of air in the soil. This change is produced whenever
the soil becomes filled with water, and then dried;
when the air above the earth is in rapid motion, and
when the comparative temperature of the upper and
lower soils changes. It causes new quantities of the
ammonia and carbonic acid which it contains to be
presented to the absorbent parts of the soil.</p>

<p>3. Under-draining <i>warms the lower parts of the
soil</i>, because the deposit of moisture (1) is necessarily
accompanied by an abstraction of heat from the atmospheric
vapor, and because heat is withdrawn
from the whole amount of air circulating through
the cooler soil.</p>

<p>When rain falls on the parched surface soil, it
robs it of a portion of its heat, which is carried down
to equalize the temperature for the whole depth.
The heat of the rain-water itself is given up to the
soil, leaving the water from one to ten degrees cooler,
when it passes out of the drains, than when received
by the earth.</p>

<p>There is always a current of air passing from the
lower to the upper end of a well constructed drain;
and this air is always cooler in warm weather, when
it issues from, than when it enters the drain. Its
lost heat is imparted to the soil.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>How does it hasten the decomposition of roots and other organic
matter in the soil?</p>

<p>How does it accelerate the disintegration of its mineral parts?</p>

<p>Why is this disintegration necessary to fertility?</p></div>

<p>This heating of the lower soil renders it more
favorable to vegetation, partially by expanding the
spongioles at the end of the roots, thus enabling them
to absorb larger quantities of nutritious matters.</p>

<p>4. Under-draining <i>hastens the decomposition of
roots and other organic matters in the soil</i>, by admitting
increased quantities of air, thus supplying
<i>oxygen</i>, which is as essential in decay as it is in combustion.
It also allows the resultant gases of decomposition
to pass away, leaving the air around the decaying
substances in a condition to continue the process.</p>

<p>This organic decay, besides its other benefits, produces
an amount of heat perfectly perceptible to the
smaller roots of plants, though not so to us.</p>

<p>5. Draining <i>accelerates the disintegration of the
mineral matters in the soil</i>, by admitting water and
oxygen to keep up the process. This disintegration is
necessary to fertility, because the roots of plants can
feed only on matters dissolved from <i>surfaces</i>; and
the more finely we pulverize the soil, the more surface
we expose. For instance, the interior of a stone
can furnish no food for plants; while, if it were finely
crushed, it might make a fertile soil.</p>

<p>Any thing, tending to open the soil to exposure,
facilitates the disintegration of its particles, and
thereby increases its fertility.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>How does under-draining equalize the distribution of the fertilizing
parts of the soil?</p>

<p>Why does this distribution lessen the impoverishment of the soil?</p>

<p>How does under-draining improve the mechanical texture of the
soil?</p>

<p>How do drains affect the excrementitious matter of plants?</p></div>

<p>6. Draining <i>causes a more even distribution of nutritious
matters among those parts of soil traversed
by roots</i>, because it increases the ease with which
water travels around, descending by its own weight,
moving sideways by a desire to find its level, or
carried upward by attraction to supply the evaporation
at the surface. By this continued motion of
the water, soluble matter of one part of the soil may
be carried to some other part; and another constituent
from this latter position may be carried back to
the former. Thus the food of vegetables is continually
circulating around among their roots, ready
for absorption at any point where it is needed, while
the more open character of the soil enables roots to
occupy larger portions, making a more even drain on
the whole, and preventing the undue impoverishment
of any part.</p>

<p>7. Under-drains <i>improve the mechanical texture
of the soil</i>; because, by the decomposition of its parts,
as previously described (4 and 5), it is rendered
of a character to be more easily worked; while
smooth round particles, which have a tendency to
pack, are roughened by the oxidation of their surfaces,
and move less easily among each other.</p>

<p>8. Drains <i>cause the excrementitious matter of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
plants to be carried out of the reach of their roots</i>.
Nearly all plants return to the soil those parts of
their food, which are not adapted to their necessities,
and usually in a form that is poisonous to plants of
the same kind. In an open soil, this matter may
be carried by rains to a point where roots cannot
reach it, and where it may undergo such changes as
will fit it to be again taken up.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Why do they prevent grasses from running out?</p></div>

<p>9. By under-draining, <i>grasses are prevented from
running out</i>, partly by preventing the accumulation
of the poisonous excrementitious matter, and
partly because these grasses usually consist of <i>tillering</i>
plants.</p>

<p>These plants continually reproduce themselves in
sprouts from the upper parts of their roots. These
sprouts become independent plants, and continue to
tiller (thus keeping the land supplied with a full
growth), until the roots of the <i>stools</i> (or clumps of
tillers), come in contact with an uncongenial part of
the soil, when the tillering ceases; the stools become
extinct on the death of their plants, and the
grasses run out.</p>

<p>The open and healthy condition of soil produced
by draining prevents the tillering from being stopped,
and thus keeps up a full growth of grass until the
nutriment of the soil is exhausted.</p>

<p>10. Draining <i>enables us to deepen the surface-soil</i>,
because the admission of air and the decay of roots<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
render the condition of the subsoil such that it may
be brought up and mixed with the surface-soil, without
injuring <i>its quality</i>.</p>

<p>The second class of advantages of under-draining,
arising in the removal of the excess of water in the
soil, are quite as important as those just described.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>How does the removal of water render soils earlier in spring?</p>

<p>Why does it prevent the throwing out of grain in winter?</p>

<p>Why does it enable us to work sooner after rains?</p>

<p>Why does it keep off the effects of cold weather longer in the
fall?</p></div>

<p>11. <i>Soils are, thereby, rendered earlier in spring</i>,
because the water, which rendered them cold, heavy,
and untillable, is earlier removed, leaving them earlier
in a growing condition.</p>

<p>12. <i>The throwing out of grain in winter</i> is prevented,
because the water falling on the earth is
immediately removed instead of remaining to throw
up the soil by freezing, as it always does from the
upright position taken by the particles of ice.</p>

<p>13. <i>We are enabled to work sooner after rains</i>,
because the water descends, and is immediately removed
instead of lying to be taken off by the slow
process of evaporation, and sinking through a heavy
soil.</p>

<p>14. <i>The effects of cold weather are kept off longer
in the fall</i>, because the excess of water is removed,
which would produce an unfertile condition on the
first appearance of cold weather.</p>

<p>The drains also, from causes already named (3),<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
keep the soil warmer than before being drained, thus
actually lengthening the season, by making the soil
warm enough for vegetable growth earlier in spring,
and later in autumn.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>How does it prevent lands from becoming sour?</p>

<p>Why does it hasten the decay of roots, and the comminution of
mineral matters?</p>

<p>How does it prevent the abstraction of heat from the soil?</p></div>

<p>15. <i>Lands are prevented from becoming sour by
the formation of acetic acid</i>, etc., because these acids
are produced in the soil only when the decomposition
of organic matter is arrested by the <i>antiseptic</i> (preserving)
powers of water. If the water is removed,
the decomposition of the organic matter assumes a
healthy form, while the acids already produced are
neutralized by atmospheric influences, and the soil
is restored from sorrel to a condition in which it is
fitted for the growth of more valuable plants.</p>

<p>16. <i>The decay of roots</i>, etc., is allowed to proceed,
because the preservative influence of too much water
is removed. Wood, leaves, or other vegetable matter
kept continually under water, will last for ages;
while, if exposed to the action of the weather, as in
under-drained soils, they soon decay.</p>

<p>The presence of too much water, by excluding
the oxygen of the air, prevents the <i>comminution of
matters</i> necessary to fertility.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>How much heat does water take up in becoming vapor?</p>

<p>Why does water sprinkled on a floor render it cooler?</p>

<p>Why is not a cubic inch of vapor warmer than a cubic inch of
water?</p>

<p>Why does a wet cloth on the head make it cooler when fanned?</p>

<p>How does this principle apply to the soil?</p></div>

<p>17. <i>The evaporation of water, and the consequent
abstraction of heat from the soil, is in a great measure
prevented</i> by draining the water out at the <i>bottom</i> of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
the soil, instead of leaving it to be dried off from the
surface.</p>

<p>When water assumes the gaseous (or vapory)
form, it takes up 1723 times as much <i>heat</i> as it contained
while a liquid. A large part of this heat is
derived from surrounding substances. When water
is sprinkled on the floor, it cools the room; because,
as it becomes a vapor, it takes heat from the room.
The reason why vapor does not feel hotter than liquid
water is, that, while it contains 1723 times as much
heat, it is 1723 as large. Hence, a cubic inch of
vapor, into which we place the bulb of a thermometer,
contains no more heat than a cubic inch of water.
The principle is the same in some other cases. A
sponge containing a table-spoonful of water is just
as <i>wet</i> as one twice as large and containing two
spoonsful.</p>

<p>If a wet cloth be placed on the head, and the
evaporation of its water assisted by fanning, the head
becomes cooler&mdash;a portion of its heat being taken to
sustain the vapory condition of the water.</p>

<p>The same principle holds true with the soil.
When the evaporation of water is rapidly going on,
by the assistance of the sun, wind, etc., a large quantity
of heat is abstracted, and the soil becomes cold.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span></p>

<p>When there is no evaporation taking place, except
of water which has been deposited on the lower portions
of soil, and carried to the surface by capillary
attraction (as is nearly true on under-drained soils),
the loss of heat is compensated by that taken from
the moisture in the atmosphere by the soil, in the
above-named manner.</p>

<p>This cooling of the soil by the evaporation of
water, is of very great injury to its powers of producing
crops, and the fact that under-drains avoid it,
is one of the best arguments in favor of their use.
Some idea may, perhaps, be formed of the amount
of heat taken from the soil in this way, from the
fact that, in midsummer, 25 hogsheads of water may
be evaporated from a single acre in twelve hours.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>When rains are allowed to <i>enter</i> the soil, how do they benefit it?</p>

<p>How do under-drains prevent the formation of a crust on the
surface of a soil?</p></div>

<p>18. When not saturated with water the soil admits
the water of rains, etc., which bring with them
<i>fertilizing gases from the atmosphere</i>, to be deposited
among the absorbent parts of soil, and given up to
the necessities of the plant. When this rain falls
on lands already saturated, it cannot enter the soil,
but must run off from the surface, or be removed by
evaporation, either of which is injurious. The first,
because fertilizing matter is washed away. The second,
because the soil is deprived of necessary heat.</p>

<p>19. <i>The formation of crust on the surface of the
soil</i> is due to the evaporation of water, which is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
drawn up from below by capillary attraction. It
arises from the fact that the water in the soil is saturated
with mineral substances, which it leaves at
its point of evaporation at the surface. This soluble
matter from below, often forms a very hard crust,
which is a complete shield to prevent the admission
of air with its ameliorating effects, and should, as
far as possible, be avoided. Under-draining is the
best means of doing this, as it is the best means of
lessening the evaporation.</p>

<p>The foregoing are some of the more important
reasons why under-draining is always beneficial.
Thorough experiments have amply proved the truth
of the theory.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>What kinds of soil are benefited by under-draining?</p></div>

<p>The <i>kinds of soil benefited by under-draining</i> are
nearly as unlimited as the kinds of soil in existence.
It is a common opinion, among farmers, that the only
soils which require draining are those which are at
times covered with water, such as swamps and other
low lands; but the facts stated in the early part of
this chapter, show us that every kind of soil&mdash;wet,
dry, compact, or light&mdash;receives benefit from the
treatment. The fact that land is <i>too dry</i>, is as
much a reason why it should be drained, as that it
is <i>too wet</i>, as it overcomes drought as effectually as it
removes the injurious effects of too much water.</p>

<p>All soils in which the water of heavy rains does
not immediately pass down to a depth of at least<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
<i>thirty inches</i>, should be under-drained, and the operation,
if carried on with judgment, would invariably
result in profit.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>What do English farmers name as the profits of under-draining?</p>

<p>What stand has been taken by the English government with
regard to under-draining?</p></div>

<p>Of the precise <i>profits</i> of under-draining this is
not the place to speak: many of the agricultural
papers contain numerous accounts of its success. It
may be well to remark here, that many English farmers
give it, as their experience, that under-drains
pay for themselves every three years, or that they
produce a perpetual profit of 33&#x2153; per cent., or their
original cost. This is not the opinion of <i>theorists</i>
and <i>book farmers</i>. It is the conviction of practical
men, who know, <i>from experience</i>, that under-drains
are beneficial.</p>

<p>The best evidence of the utility of under-draining
is the position, with regard to it, which has been
taken by the English national government, which
affords much protection to the agricultural interests
of her people&mdash;a protection which in this country is
unwisely and unjustly withheld.</p>

<p>In England a very large sum from the public
treasury has been appropriated as a fund for loans,
on under-drains, which is lent to farmers for the purpose
of under-draining their estates, the only security
given being the increased value of the soil. The
time allowed for payments is twenty years, and only
five per cent. interest is charged. By the influence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
of this patronage, the actual wealth of the kingdom
is being rapidly increased, while the farmers themselves,
can raise their farms to any desired state of
fertility, without immediate investment.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>How does under-draining affect the healthfulness of marshy
countries?</p>

<p>Describe the sub-soil plow.</p></div>

<p>The best proof that the government has not
acted injudiciously in this matter is, that private
capitalists are fast employing their money in the
same manner, and loans on under-drains are considered
a very safe investment.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that we may soon have similar
facilities for improving our farms, and when we do,
we shall find that it is unnecessary to move West to
find good soil. The districts nearer market, where
the expense of transportation is much less, may, by
the aid of under-drains, and a judicious system of
cultivation, be made equally fertile.</p>

<p>One very important, though not strictly agricultural,
effect of thorough drainage is its removal of
certain local diseases, peculiar to the vicinity of
marshy or low moist soils. The health-reports in
several places in England, show that where <i>fever and
ague</i> was once common, it has almost entirely disappeared
since the general use of under-drains in
those localities.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>

<h3>SUB-SOIL PLOWING.</h3>


<div class="sidenote"><p>Describe the Mapes plow.</p>

<p>Why is the motion in the soil of one and a half inches sufficient?</p>

<p>How does the oxidation of the particles of the soil resemble the

<p>The <i>sub-soil plow</i> is an implement differing in figure
from the surface plow. It does not turn a furrow,
but merely runs through the subsoil like a mole&mdash;loosening
and making it finer by lifting, but allowing
it to fall back and occupy its former place. It
usually follows the surface plow, entering the soil to
the depth of from twelve to eighteen inches below
the bottom of the surface furrow.</p>

<p>The best pattern now made (the Mapes plow) is
represented in the following figure.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 635px;">

</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span></p>

<p>The sub-soil plows first made raised the whole soil
about eight inches, and required very great power in
their use often six, eight, or even ten oxen. The
Mapes plow, raising the soil but slightly, may be
worked with much less power, and produces equally
good results. It may be run to its full depth in most
soils by a single yoke of oxen.</p>

<p>Of course a motion in the soil of but one and a half
inches is very slight, but it is sufficient to move each
particle from the one next to it which, in dry soils, is
all that is necessary. Whoever has examined a pile
of cannon-balls must have observed that at the points
where they touch each other, there is a little rust. In
the soil, the same is often the case. Where the particles
touch each other, there is such a chemical change
produced as renders them fit for the use of plants.
While these particles remain in their first position,
the changed portions are out of the reach of roots;
but, if, by the aid of the sub-soil plow, their position
is altered, these parts are exposed for the uses of
plants. If we hold in the hand a ball of dry clay,
and press it hard enough to produce the least motion
among its particles, the whole mass becomes pulverized.
On the same principle, the sub-soil plow
renders the compact lower soil sufficiently fine for the
requirements of fertility.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Why are the benefits of sub-soiling not permanent on wet lands?</p>

<p>Does sub-soiling overcome drought?</p>

<p>How does it deepen the surface soil?</p></div>

<p>Notwithstanding its great benefits on land, which
is sufficiently dry, sub-soiling cannot be recommended
for wet lands; for, in such case, the rains of a single
season would often be sufficient to entirely overcome
its effects by packing the subsoil down to its former
hardness.</p>

<p>On lands not overcharged with water, it is
productive of the best results, it being often sufficient
to turn the balance between a gaining and
a losing business in farming.</p>

<p>It increases nearly every effect of under-draining;
especially does it overcome drought, by loosening the
soil, and admitting air to circulate among the particles
of the subsoil and deposit its moisture on the principle
described in the chapter on under-draining.</p>

<p>It deepens the surface-soil, because it admits roots
into the subsoil where they decay and leave carbon,
while the circulation of air so affects the mineral
parts, that they become of a fertilizing character.
The deposit of carbon gives to the subsoil the power
of absorbing, and retaining the atmospheric fertilizers,
which are more freely presented, owing to the fact
that the air is allowed to circulate with greater
freedom. As a majority of roots decay in the surface-soil,
they there deposit much mineral matter obtained
from the subsoil.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Why is the retention of atmospheric manures ensured by sub-soiling?</p>

<p>Why are organic manures plowed deeply under the soil, less
liable to evaporation than when deposited near the surface?</p>

<p>How does sub-soiling resemble under-draining in relation to the
tillering of grasses?</p>

<p>When the subsoil consists of a thin layer of clay on a sandy bed,
what use may be made of the sub-soil plow?</p></div>

<p>The retention of atmospheric manures is more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
fully ensured by the better exposure of the clayey
portions of the soil.</p>

<p>Those manures which are artificially applied, by
being plowed under to greater depths, are less liable
to evaporation, as, from the greater amount of soil
above them, their escape will more probably be
arrested; and, from the greater prevalence of roots,
they are more liable to be taken up by plants.</p>

<p>The subsoil often contains matters which are deficient
in the surface-soil. By the use of the sub-soil
plow, they are rendered available.</p>

<p>Sub-soiling is similar to under-draining in continuing
the tillering of grasses, and in getting rid of
the poisonous excrementitious matter of plants.</p>

<p>When the subsoil is a thin layer of clay on a
sandy bed (as in some plants of Cumberland Co.
Maine), the sub-soil plow, by passing through it,
opens a passage for water, and often affords a sufficient
drainage.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>To how great a depth will the roots of plants usually occupy
the soil?</p>

<p>What is the object of loosening the soil?</p>

<p>How are these various effects better produced in deep than in
shallow soils?</p></div>

<p>If plants will grow better on a soil six inches
deep than on one of three inches, there is no reason
why they should not be benefited in proportion, by
disturbing the soil to the whole depth to which roots
will travel&mdash;which is usually more than two feet.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
The minute rootlets of corn and most other plants,
will, if allowed by cultivation, occupy the soil to the
depth or thirty-four inches, having a fibre in nearly
every cubic inch of the soil for the whole distance.
There are very few cultivated plants whose roots
would not travel to a depth of thirty inches or more.
Even the onion sends its roots to the depth of
eighteen inches when the soil is well cultivated.</p>

<p>The object of loosening the soil is to admit
roots to a sufficient depth to hold the plant in its
position&mdash;to obtain the nutriment necessary to its
growth&mdash;to receive moisture from the lower portions
of the soil&mdash;and, if it be a bulb, tuber, or tap, to
assume the form requisite for its largest development.</p>

<p>It must be evident that roots, penetrating the
soil to a depth of two feet, anchor the plant with
greater stability than those which are spread more
thinly near the surface.</p>

<p>The roots of plants traversing the soil to such
great distances, and being located in nearly every
part, absorb mineral and other food, in solution in
water, only through the <i>spongioles at their ends</i>.
Consequently, by having these ends in <i>every part</i>
of the soil, it is <i>all</i> brought under contribution, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
the amount supplied is greater, while the demand on
any particular part may be less than when the whole
requirements of plants have to be supplied from a
depth of a few inches.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>May garden soils be profitably imitated in field culture?</p></div>

<p>The ability of roots, to assume a natural shape
in the soil, and grow to their largest sizes, must
depend on the condition of the soil. If it is finely
pulverized to the whole depth to which they ought
to go, they will be fully developed; while, if the soil
be too hard for penetration, they will be deformed
or small. Thus a carrot may grow to the length of
two and a half feet, and be of perfect shape, while, if
it meet in its course at a depth of eight or ten inches
a <i>cold, hard</i> subsoil, its growth must be arrested, or
its form injured.</p>

<p>Roots are turned aside by a hard sub-soil, as
they would be if received by the surface of a plate of
glass.</p>

<p>Add to this the fact that cold, impenetrable subsoils
are <i>chemically</i> uncongenial to vegetation, and
we have sufficient evidence of the importance, and
in many cases the absolute necessity of sub-soiling
and under-draining.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to urge the fact that a garden soil
of two feet is more productive than a field soil of six
inches; and it is certain that proper attention to
these two modes of cultivation will in a majority of
cases make a garden of the field&mdash;more than doubling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
its value in ease of working, increased produce, certain
security against drought, and more even distribution
of the demands on the soil&mdash;while the outlay
will be immediately repaid by an increase of crops.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Is the use of the sub-soil plow increasing?</p>

<p>Will its use ever injure crops?</p></div>

<p>The subsoil will be much improved in its character
the first year, and a continual advancement
renders it in time equal to the original surface-soil,
and extending to a depth of two feet or more.</p>

<p>The sub-soil plow is coming rapidly into use.
There are now in New Jersey more foundries casting
sub-soil plows than there were sub-soil plows in the
State six years ago. The implement has there, as
well as in many other places, ceased to be a curiosity;
and the man who now objects to its use, is classed
with him who shells his corn on a shovel over a half-bushel,
instead of employing an improved machine,
which will enable him to do more in a day than he
can do in the "good old way" in a week.</p>

<p>Had we space, we might give many instances of
the success of sub-soiling, but the agricultural papers
of the present day (at least one of which every farmer
should take) have so repeatedly published its advantages,
that we will not do so.</p>

<p>In no case will its use be found any thing but
satisfactory, except in occasional instances where
there is some chemical difficulty in the subsoil, which
an analysis will tell us how to overcome.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span></p>

<p>As was before stated, its use on wet lands is not
advisable until they have been under-drained, as
excess of water prevents its effects from being permanent.</p>

<h3>PLOWING AND OTHER MODES OF PULVERIZING
THE SOIL.</h3>


<div class="sidenote"><p>May the satisfaction attending labor be increased by an understanding
of the natural laws which regulate our operations?</p>

<p>On what depends the kind of plow to be used?</p></div>

<p>The advantages of pulverizing the soil, and the <i>reasons</i>
why it is necessary, are now too well known to
need remark. Few farmers, when they plow, dig, or
harrow, are enabled to give substantial reasons for
so doing. If they will reflect on what has been said
in the previous chapters, concerning the supply of
mineral food to the plant by the soil, and the effect
of air and moisture about roots, they will find more
satisfaction in their labor than it can afford when
applied without thought.</p>


<h3 class="gap2">PLOWING.</h3>

<div class="sidenote"><p>What is a general rule with regard to this?</p>

<p>Should deep plowing be immediately adopted? Why?</p>

<p>Why is this course of treatment advisable for garden culture?</p></div>

<p>The kind of plow used in cultivating the surface-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>soil
must be decided by the kind of soil. This question
the practical, <i>observing</i> farmer will be able to
solve.</p>

<p>As a general rule, it may be stated that the plow
which runs the <i>deepest</i>, with the same amount of
force, is the best.</p>

<p>We might enter more fully into this matter but
for want of space.</p>

<p>The advantages of <i>deep plowing</i> cannot be too
strongly urged.</p>

<p>The statement that the <i>deeper</i> and the <i>finer</i> the
soil is rendered, the more productive it will become,
is in every respect true, and which no single instance
will contradict.</p>

<p>It must not be inferred from this, that we would
advise a farmer, who has always plowed his soil to
the depth of only six inches, to double the depth at
once. Such a practice in some soils would be highly
injurious, as it would completely bury the more fertile
and better cultivated soil, and bring to the top
one which contains no organic matter, and has never
been subject to atmospheric influences. This
would, perhaps, be so little fitted for vegetation that
it would scarcely sustain plants until their roots could
reach the more fertile parts below. Such treatment
of the soil (turning it upside down) is excellent in
<i>garden</i> culture, where the great amount of manures<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
applied is sufficient to overcome the temporary barrenness
of the soil, but it is not to be recommended
for all <i>field</i> cultivation, where much less manure is
employed.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>How should field plowing be conducted?</p>

<p>How does such treatment affect soils previously limed?</p>

<p>How may it sometimes improve sandy or clay soils?</p></div>

<p>The course to be pursued in such cases is to <i>plow
one inch deeper each year</i>. By this means the soil
maybe gradually deepened to any desired extent.
The amount of uncongenial soil which will thus be
brought up, is slight, and will not interfere at all with
the fertility of the soil, while the elevated portion
will become, in one year, so altered by exposure,
that it will equal the rest of the soil in fertility.</p>

<p>Often where lime has been used in excess, it has
sunk to the subsoil, where it remains inactive. The
slight deepening of the surface plowing would mix
this lime with the surface-soil, and render it again
useful.</p>

<p>When the soil is light and sandy, resting on a
heavy clay subsoil, or clay on sand, the bringing
up of the mass from below will improve the texture
of the soil.</p>

<p>As an instance of the success of deep plowing, we
call to mind the case of a farmer in New Jersey,
who had a field which had yielded about twenty-five
bushels of corn per acre. It had been cultivated at
ordinary depths. After laying it out in eight step
lands (24 feet), he plowed it at all depths from five<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
to ten inches, on the different lands, and sowed oats
evenly over the whole field. The crop on the five
inch soil was very poor, on the six inch rather better,
on the seven inch better still, and on the ten inch
soil it was as fine as ever grew in New Jersey;
it had stiff straw and broad leaves, while the grain
was also much better than on the remainder of
the field.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>What kind of soils are benefited by fall plowing?</p></div>

<p>There is an old anecdote of a man who died,
leaving his sons with the information that he had
buried a pot of gold for them, somewhere on the
farm. They commenced digging for the gold, and
dug over the whole farm to a great depth without
finding the gold. The digging, however, so enriched
the soil that they were fully compensated for their
disappointment, and became wealthy from the increased
produce of their farm.</p>

<p>Farmers will find, on experiment, that they have
gold buried in their soil, if they will but dig deep
enough to obtain it. The law gives a man the ownership
of the soil for an indefinite distance from the
surface, but few seem to realize that there is <i>another
farm</i> below the one they are cultivating, which is
quite as valuable as the one on the surface, if it were
but properly worked.</p>

<p><i>Fall plowing</i>, especially for heavy lands, is a very
good means of securing the action of the frosts of
winter to pulverize the soil. If it be a stiff clay, it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
may be well to throw the soil up into ridges (by
ridging and back furrowing), so as to expose the
largest possible amount of surface to the freezing
and thawing of winter. Sandy soils should not be
plowed in the fall, as it renders them too light.</p>


<h3 class="gap2">DIGGING MACHINES.</h3>

<div class="sidenote"><p>What is the digging machine?</p></div>

<p>A recent invention has been made in England,
known as the digging machine or rotary spade, which&mdash;although
from having too much gearing between
the power and the part performing the labor, it is not
adapted to general use&mdash;has given such promise of
future success, that Mr. Mechi (an agricultural writer
of the highest standing) has said that "the plow is
doomed." This can hardly be true, for the varied
uses to which it may be applied, will guarantee its
continuance in the favor of the farmer.</p>

<p>Already, in this country, Messrs. Gibbs &amp; Mapes,
have invented a digging machine of very simple construction,
which seems calculated to serve an excellent
purpose, even in the hands of the farmer of limited
means.</p>

<p>Its friends assert that, with one pair of oxen, it
will dig perfectly three feet wide, and for a depth of
fifteen inches. An experiment with an unperfected
machine, in the presence of the writer, seemed to
justify their hopes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p>

<p>This machine thoroughly pulverizes the soil to a
considerable depth, and for smooth land must prove
far superior to the plow.</p>


<h3 class="gap2">THE HARROW AND CULTIVATOR.</h3>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Why is the harrow a defective implement?</p>

<p>Why is the cultivator superior to the harrow?</p></div>

<p>The <i>harrow</i>, an implement largely used in all
parts of the world, to pulverize the soil, and break
clods, has become so firmly rooted in the affections
of farmers, that it must be a very long time before
they can be convinced that it is not the best implement
for the use to which it is devoted. It is true
that it pulverizes the soil for a depth of two or three
inches, and thus much improves its appearance, benefiting
it, without doubt, for the earliest stages of the
growth of plants. Its action, however, is very defective,
because, from the <i>wedge</i> shape of its teeth, it
continually acts to <i>pack</i> the soil; thus&mdash;although favorable
for the germination of the seed&mdash;it is not calculated
to benefit the plant during the later stages of
its growth, when the roots require the soil to be pulverized
to a considerable depth.</p>

<p>The <i>cultivator</i> may be considered an <i>improved
harrow</i>. The principal difference between them
being, that while the teeth of the harrow are pointed
at the lower end, those of the cultivator are shaped
like a small double plow, being large at the bottom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
and growing smaller towards the top. They lift the
earth up, instead of pressing it downwards, thus loosening
instead of compacting the soil.</p>

<p>Many styles of cultivators are now sold at agricultural
warehouses. A very good one, for field use,
may be made by substituting the cultivator teeth for
the spikes in an old harrow frame.</p>



<h2 class="gap4">CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3>ROLLING, MULCHING, WEEDING, ETC.</h3>


<h3 class="gap2">ROLLING.</h3>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Name some of the benefits of rolling?</p></div>

<p><i>Rolling</i> the soil with a large roller, arranged to be
drawn by a team, is in many instances a good accessory
to cultivation. By its means, the following
results are obtained:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The soil at the surface is pulverized without
the compacting of the lower parts, the area of contact
being large.</p>

<p>2. The stones on the land are pressed down so as
to be out of the way of the scythe in mowing.</p>

<p>3. The soil is compacted around seeds after sowing
in such a manner as to exclude light and to <i>touch</i>
them in every part, both of which are essential<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
to their germination and to the healthfulness of the
plants.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Under what circumstances should the roller be used?</p></div>

<p>4. The soil is so compacted at the surface, that
it is less frequented by <i>grubs</i>, etc., than when it is
more loose.</p>

<p>5. When the soil is smoothed in this manner,
there is less surface exposed for the evaporation of
water with its cooling effect.</p>

<p>6. Light sandy lands, by being rolled in the fall,
are rendered more compact, and the loosening effects
of frequent freezing and thawing are avoided.</p>

<p>Although productive of these various effects, rolling
should be adopted only with much care, and
should never be applied to very heavy lands, except
in dry weather when lumpy after plowing, as its
tendency in such cases would be to render them still
more difficult of cultivation. Soils in which air does
not circulate freely, are not improved by rolling, as
it presses the surface-particles still more closely
together, and prevents the free admission of the atmosphere.</p>

<p>If well <i>under-drained</i>, a large majority of soils
would doubtless be benefited by a judicious use of the
roller.<a name="FNanchor_AL_38" id="FNanchor_AL_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_AL_38" class="fnanchor">[AL]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>

<h3 class="gap2">MULCHING.</h3>

<div class="sidenote"><p>What is mulching?</p>

<p>What are some of its benefits?</p></div>

<p><i>Mulching</i> (called Gurneyism in England) consists
in covering the soil with salt hay, litter, seaweed,
leaves, spent tanbark, chips, or other refuse matter.</p>

<p>Every farmer must have noticed that, if a board
or rail, or an old brush-heap be removed in spring
from soil where grass is growing, the grass afterwards
grows in those places much larger and better than
in other parts of the field.</p>

<p>This improvement arises from various causes.</p>

<p>1. The evaporation of water from the soil is prevented
during drought by the shade afforded by the
mulch; and it is therefore kept in better condition,
as to moisture and temperature, than when evaporation
goes on more freely. This condition is well calculated
to advance the chemical changes necessary to
prepare the matters&mdash;both organic and mineral&mdash;in
the soil for the use of plants.</p>

<p>2. By preventing evaporation, we partially protect
the soil from losing ammonia resultant from
decaying organic matter.</p>

<p>3. A heavy mulch breaks the force of rains, and
prevents them from compacting the soil, as would be
the result, were no such precaution taken.</p>

<p>4. Mulching protects the surface-soil from freezing
as readily as when exposed, and thus keeps it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
longer open for the admission of air and moisture.
When unprotected, the soil early becomes frozen;
and all water falling, instead of entering as it should
do, passes off on the surface.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Why does mulching take the place of artificial watering?</p>

<p>Why is the late sowing of oats beneficial?</p>

<p>From what arises the chief benefit of top dressing the soil with
manure in autumn?</p></div>

<p>5. The throwing out of winter grain is often prevented,
because this is due to the freezing of the
surface-soil.</p>

<p>6. Mulching prevents the growth of some weeds,
because it removes from them the fostering heat of
the sun.</p>

<p>Many of the best nursery-men keep the soil about
the roots of young trees mulched continually. One
of the chief arguments for this treatment is, that it
prevents the removal of the moisture from the soil
and the consequent loss of heat. Also that it keeps
up a full supply of water for the uses of the roots, because
it keeps the soil cool, and causes a deposit of dew.</p>

<p>7. It also prevents the "baking" of the soil, or the
formation of a crust.</p>

<p>It is to be recommended in nearly all cases to sow
oats very thinly over land intended for winter fallow
after the removal of crops, as they will grow a little
before being killed by the frost, when they will fall
down, thus affording a very beneficial mulch to the soil.</p>

<p>When farmers spread manure on their fields in the
fall to be plowed under in the spring, they benefit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
the land by the mulching more than by the addition
of fertilizing matter, because they give it the protecting
influence of the straw, etc., while they lose
much of the ammonia of their manure by evaporation.
The same mulching might be more cheaply
done with leaves, or other refuse matter, and the
ammonia of the manure made available by composting
with absorbents.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Why is snow particularly beneficial?</p></div>

<p>It is an old and true saying that "snow is the
poor man's manure." The reason why it is so beneficial
is, chiefly, that it acts as a most excellent
mulch. It contains no more ammonia than rain-water
does; and, were it not for the fact that it
protects the soil against loss of heat, and produces
other benefits of mulching, it would have no more
advantageous effect. The severity of winters at the
North is partially compensated by the long duration
of snow.</p>

<p>It is a well known fact that when there is but
little snow in cold countries, wheat is very liable to
be <i>winter killed</i>. The same protection is afforded by
artificial mulching.</p>

<p>This treatment is peculiarly applicable to the
cultivation of flowers, both in pots and in beds out
of doors. It is almost indispensable to the profitable
production of strawberries, and many other garden
crops, such as asparagus, rhubarb, etc. Many say
that the best treatment for trees is to put stones<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
about their roots. This is simply <i>mulching</i> them,
and might be done more cheaply by the use of leaves,
copying the action of nature in forests;<a name="FNanchor_AM_39" id="FNanchor_AM_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_AM_39" class="fnanchor">[AM]</a> for, unless
these stones be removed in spring, they will sink and
compact the soil in part during open weather.</p>


<h3 class="gap2">WEEDING.</h3>

<div class="sidenote"><p>What are some of the uses of weeds? Their disadvantages?</p></div>

<p>If a farmer were asked&mdash;what is the use of <i>weeds</i>?
he might make out quite a list of their benefits,
among which might be some of the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. They shade tender plants, and in a measure
serve as a mulch to the ground.</p>

<p>2. Some weeds, by their offensive odor, drive
away many insects.</p>

<p>3. They may serve as a green crop to be plowed
into the soil, and increase its organic matter.</p>

<p>4. <i>They make us stir the soil</i>, and thus increase
its fertility.</p>

<p>Still, while thinking out these excuses for weeds,
he would see other and more urgent reasons why they
should not be allowed to grow.</p>

<p>1. They occupy the soil to the disadvantage of
crops.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span></p>
<p>2. They exclude light and heat from cultivated
plants, and thus interfere with their growth.</p>

<p>3. They take up mineral and other matters from
the soil, and hold them during the growing season,
thus depriving crops of their use.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to argue the injury done by
weeds. Every farmer is well convinced that they
should be destroyed, and the best means of accomplishing
this are of the greatest importance.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>How may we protect ourselves against their increase?</p>

<p>Why is it especially important for this purpose to maintain the
balance of the soil?</p></div>

<p>In the first place, we should protect ourselves
against their increase. This may be done:&mdash;</p>

<p>By decomposing all manures in compost, whereby
the seeds contained will be killed by the heat of
fermentation; or, if one bushel of salt be mixed
through each cord of compost (as before recommended),
it will kill seeds as well as grubs,&mdash;</p>

<p>By hoeing, or, otherwise, destroying growing
weeds before they mature their seeds, and</p>

<p>By keeping the soil in the best chemical condition.</p>

<p>This last point is one of much importance. It
is well known that soils deficient in potash, will
naturally produce one kind of plants, while soils
deficient in phosphoric acid will produce plants
of another species, etc. Many soils produce certain
weeds which would not grow on them if they were
made chemically perfect, as indicated by analysis. It is
also believed that those weeds, which naturally grow on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
the most fertile soils, are the ones most easily destroyed.
There are exceptions (of which the Thistle
is one), but this is given as a general rule.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>How much salt may be used with advantage?</p>

<p>Why is the scuffle-hoe superior to the common hoe?</p></div>

<p>By careful attention to the foregoing points,
weeds may be kept from increasing while those
already in the soil may be eradicated in various
ways, chiefly by mechanical means, such as hoeing,
plowing, etc.<a name="FNanchor_AN_40" id="FNanchor_AN_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_AN_40" class="fnanchor">[AN]</a></p>

<p>Prof. Mapes says that six bushels of salt annually
sown broadcast over each acre of land, will destroy
very many weeds as well as grubs and worms.</p>

<p>The <i>common hoe</i> is a very imperfect tool for the
purpose of removing weeds, as it prepares a better
soil for, and replants in a position to grow, nearly as
many weeds as it destroys.</p>

<p>The <i>scuffle-hoe</i> (or push-hoe) is much more effective,
as, when worked by a man walking backwards,
and retiring as he works, it leaves nearly all of the
weeds on the surface of the soil to be killed by the
sun. When used in this way, the earth is not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
trodden on after being hoed&mdash;as is the case when
the common hoe is employed. This treading, besides
compacting the soil, covers the roots of many weeds,
and causes them to grow again.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>How may much labor be saved in removing weeds?</p>

<p>What is the Langdon horse-hoe?</p>

<p>Describe the <i>universal</i> cultivator?</p></div>

<p>Much of the labor of weeding usually performed
by men, might be more cheaply done by horses.
There are various implements for this purpose, some
of which are coming, in many parts of the country,
into very general use.</p>

<p>One of the best of these is the <i>Langdon Horse
Hoe</i>, which is a shovel-shaped plow, to be run one
or two inches deep. It has a wing on each side to
prevent the earth from falling on to the plants in the
rows. At the rear, or upper edge, is a kind of rake
or comb, which allows the earth to pass through,
while the weeds pass over the comb and fall on the
surface of the soil, to be killed by the heat of the
sun. It is a simple and cheap tool, and will perform
the work of twenty men with hoes. The hand hoe
will be necessary only in the rows.</p>


<h3 class="gap2">CULTIVATOR.</h3>

<p>The <i>cultivator</i>, which was described in the preceding
chapter, and of which there are various patterns
in use, is excellent for weeding, and for loosening
the soil between the rows of corn, etc. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
one called the <i>universal</i> cultivator, having its side
bars made of iron, curved so that at whatever distance
it is placed the teeth will point <i>straight forward</i>,
is a much better tool than those of the older
patterns, which had the teeth so arranged that when
set for wide rows, they pointed towards the clevis.
It is difficult to keep such a cultivator in its place,
while the "<i>universal</i>" is as difficult to move out of
a straight line.</p>

<p>Until within a comparatively short period, but
little attention has been paid to the production of
machines for harvesting the various crops.</p>

<p>During the past few years, however, many valuable
inventions have appeared. Among these we
notice Ketchum's mower, Hussey's mower and reaper,
and Wagener's grain and grass seed harvester. The
latter machine gathers only the grain and seeds of
the crop, leaving the straw to be plowed under the
soil, thus maintaining its supply of soluble silicates,
and increasing its amount of organic matter. After
taking the seed heads from the standing straw and
grasses, it thrashes them, blows out the chaff, separates
the different kinds of seeds, and discharges
them into bags ready for market. It consists of a
car containing the machinery; to this may be attached
any required number of horses. The inventor
affirms that it has harvested the grain of two acres
in one hour, performing the work with accuracy.<a name="FNanchor_AP_42" id="FNanchor_AP_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_AP_42" class="fnanchor">[AP]</a></p>

<h2>ANALYSIS.</h2>




<h2 class="gap4">CHAPTER I.</h2>


<div class="sidenote"><p>Why does true practical economy require that the soil should be
analyzed?</p></div>

<p>At the present time, when such marked improvements
have been, and are still being made, in the
practice of agriculture, the farmer cannot be too
strongly advised to procure an analysis of his soil,
and for obvious reasons.</p>

<p>It has been sufficiently proved that the plant
draws from the soil certain kinds of mineral matter,
in certain proportions; also, that if the soil do not
contain the constituents required, the plants cannot
obtain them, and consequently cannot grow. Furthermore,
in proportion to the ability of the soil to
supply these materials, in exactly the same propor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>tion
will it, when under good treatment, produce
good and abundant crops.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Can each farmer make his own analyses?</p>

<p>Why will not travelling chemists answer the purpose?</p>

<p>How must an analysis be used?</p></div>

<p>All admit the value and the necessity of manures;
they are required to make up deficiencies
in the soil, and consequently, they must supply to it
the matters which are wanting. In order to know
what is wanting, we must know the composition of
the soil. This can be learned only by accurate chemical
analysis. Such an analysis every farmer must
possess before he can conduct his operations with <i>true
practical economy</i>.</p>

<p>An important question now arises as to whether
each farmer can make his own analyses. He cannot
do so without long study and practice. The late
Prof. Norton said that, at least <i>two years'</i> time would
be necessary to enable a man to become competent
to make a reliable analysis. When we reflect
that a farmer may never need more than five or six
analyses, we shall see that the time necessary to learn
the art would be much more valuable than the cost
of the analyses (at $5 or $10 each), setting aside the
cost of apparatus, and the fact that while practising
in the laboratory, he must not use his hands for any
labor that would unfit them for the most delicate
manipulations.</p>

<p>Neither will <i>travelling</i> chemists be able to make
analyses as accurately and as cheaply as those who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
work in their own laboratories, where their apparatus
is not liable to the many injuries consequent on frequent
removal. The cost of sending one hundred
samples of soil to a distant chemist, would be much
less than the expense of having his apparatus brought
to the town where his services are required.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>How may a farmer obtain the requisite knowledge?</p>

<p>When are the services of a consulting agriculturist required?</p></div>

<p><i>The way in which an analysis should be used</i> is a
matter of much importance. To a man who knows
nothing of chemistry (be he ever so successful a farmer),
an analysis, as received from a chemist, would
be as useless and unintelligible as though it were written
in Chinese; while, if a chemist who knew nothing
of farming, were to give him advice concerning the application
of manures, he would be led equally astray,
and his course would be any thing but <i>practical</i>. It
is necessary that chemical and practical knowledge
should be combined, and then the value of analysis
will be fully demonstrated. The <i>amount</i> of knowledge
required is not great, but it must be <i>thorough</i>.
The information contained in this little book is sufficient,
but it would be folly for a man to attempt to
use an analysis from reading it once hurriedly over.
It must be studied and thought on with great care,
before it can be of material assistance. The evenings
of one winter, devoted to this subject, will enable
a farmer to understand the application of analysis
to practical farming, especially if other and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
more compendious works are also read. A less time
could hardly be recommended.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Is there any doubt as to the practical value of analysis?</p>

<p>How should samples of soil for analysis be selected?</p></div>

<p>Where this attention cannot be given to the subject,
the services of a Consulting Agriculturist should
be employed to advise the treatment necessary to render
fertile the soil analyzed.</p>

<p>Every farmer, however, should learn enough of
the principles of agriculture to be able to use an
analysis, when procured, without such assistance.<a name="FNanchor_AQ_43" id="FNanchor_AQ_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_AQ_43" class="fnanchor">[AQ]</a></p>

<p>Nearly all scientific men (all of the highest merit)
are unanimous in their conviction of the <i>practical</i>
value of an analysis of soils; and a volume of instances
of their success, with hardly a single failure,
might be published.</p>

<p>Prof. Mapes says, in the <i>Working Farmer</i>, that
he has given advice on hundreds of different soils,
and <i>not a single instance</i> can be found where he has
failed to produce a profit greater than the cost of
analysis and advice. Dr. T. C. Jackson, of Boston,
the late Prof. Norton, of Yale College, and others,
have had universal success in this matter.</p>

<p>Analysis must be considered the only sure road
to economical farming.</p>

<p><i>To select samples of soil for analysis</i>, take a
spadeful from various parts of the field&mdash;going to
exactly the depth to which it has been plowed&mdash;until,
say a wheel-barrow full, has been obtained. Mix<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
this well together, and send about a quart or a pint of
it (free from stones) to the chemist. This will represent
all of that part of the farm which has been subject
to the same cultivation, and is of the same mechanical
character. If there are marked differences
in the kinds of soil, separate analyses will be necessary.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Give an instance of the success of treatment according to analysis?</p></div>

<p>When an analysis is obtained, a regular debtor
and creditor account may be kept with the soil; and
the farmer may know by the composition of the ashes
of his crops, and the manures supplied, whether he
is maintaining the fertility of his soil.</p>

<p>Prof. Mapes once purchased some land which
could not produce corn at all, and by applying only
such manures as analysis indicated to be necessary,
at a cost of less than $2 per acre, he obtained
the first year over <i>fifty bushels of shelled corn per
acre</i>. The land has since continued to improve, and
is as fertile as any in the State. It has produced in
one season a sufficient crop of cabbages to pay the
expense of cultivation, and over $250 per acre besides,
though it was apparently <i>worthless</i> when he
purchased it.</p>

<p>These are strong facts, and should arouse the farmers
of the whole country to their true interests.
Let them not call the teachings of science "book-farming,"
but "prove all things&mdash;hold fast that
which is good."</p>

<h2 class="gap4"><a name="THE_PRACTICAL_FARMER" id="THE_PRACTICAL_FARMER"></a>THE PRACTICAL FARMER.</h2>


<p>Who is the <i>practical farmer</i>? Let us look at two
pictures and decide.</p>

<p>Here is a farm of 100 acres in ordinary condition.
It is owned and tilled by a hard-working man,
who, in the busy season, employs one or two assistants.
The farm is free from debt, but it does not
produce an abundant income; therefore, its owner
cannot afford to purchase the best implements, or
make other needed improvements; besides, he don't
<i>believe</i> in such things. His father was a good solid
farmer; so was his grandfather; and so is he, or
thinks he is. He is satisfied that 'the good old way'
is best, and he sticks to it. He works from morning
till night; from spring till fall. In the winter, he
<i>rests</i>, as much as his lessened duties will allow.
During this time, he reads little, or nothing. Least
of all does he read about farming. He don't want
to learn how to dig potatoes out of a book. Book
farming is nonsense. Many other similar ideas keep
him from agricultural reading. His house is comfort<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>able,
and his barns are quite as good as his neighbors',
while his farm gives him a living. It is true
that his soil does not produce as much as it did ten
years ago; but prices are better, and he is satisfied.</p>

<p>Let us look at his premises, and see how his
affairs are managed. First, examine the land. Well,
it is good fair land. Some of it is a little springy,
but is not to be called <i>wet</i>. It will produce a ton
and a half of hay to the acre&mdash;it used to produce
two tons. There are some stones on the land, but not
enough in his estimation to do harm. The plowed
fields are pretty good; they will produce 35 bushels
of corn, 13 bushels of wheat, or 30 bushels of oats
per acre, when the season is not dry. His father
used to get more; but, somehow, the <i>weather</i> is not
so favorable as it was in old times. He has thought
of raising root crops, but they take more labor than
he can afford to hire. Over, in the back part of the
land there is a muck-hole, which is the only piece of
<i>worthless</i> land on the whole farm.</p>

<p>Now, let us look at the barns and barn-yards.
The stables are pretty good. There are some wide
cracks in the siding, but they help to ventilate, and
make it healthier for the cattle. The manure is
thrown out of the back windows, and is left in piles
under the eaves on the sunny side of the barn. The
rain and sun make it nicer to handle. The cattle
have to go some distance for water; and this gives
them exercise. All of the cattle are not kept in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
stable; the fattening stock are kept in the various
fields, where hay is fed out to them from the stack.
The barn-yard is often occupied by cattle, and is
covered with their manure, which lies there until it
is carted on to the land. In the shed are the tools
of the farm, consisting of carts, plows&mdash;not deep
plows, this farmer thinks it best to have roots near
the surface of the soil where they can have the benefit
of the sun's heat,&mdash;a harrow, hoes, rakes, etc. These
tools are all in good order; and, unlike those of his
less prudent neighbor, they are protected from the
weather.</p>

<p>The crops are cultivated with the plow, and hoe,
as they have been since the land was cleared, and
as they always will be until this man dies.</p>

<p>Here is the 'practical farmer' of the present day.
Hard working, out of debt, and economical&mdash;of dollars
and cents, if not of soil and manures. He is a
better farmer than two thirds of the three millions
of farmers in the country. He is one of the best
farmers in his town&mdash;there are but few better in the
county, not many in the State. He represents the
better class of his profession.</p>

<p>With all this, he is, in matters relating to his
business, an unreading, unthinking man. He knows
nothing of the first principles of farming, and is successful
by the <i>indulgence</i> of nature, not because he
understands her, and is able to make the most of her
assistance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span></p>

<p>This is an unpleasant fact, but it is one which
cannot be denied. We do not say this to disparage
the farmer, but to arouse him to a realization of his
position and of his power to improve it.</p>

<p>But let us see where he is wrong.</p>

<p>He is wrong in thinking that his land does not
need draining. He is wrong in being satisfied with
one and a half tons of hay to the acre when he might
easily get two and a half. He is wrong in not removing
as far as possible every stone that can interfere
with the deep and thorough cultivation of his
soil. He is wrong in reaping less than his father did,
when he should get more. He is wrong in ascribing
to the weather, and similar causes, what is due to
the actual impoverishment of his soil. He is wrong
in not raising turnips, carrots, and other roots, which
his winter stock so much need, when they might be
raised at a cost of less than one third of their value
as food. He is wrong in considering worthless a deposit
of muck, which is a mine of wealth if properly
employed. He is wrong in <i>ventilating</i> his stables at
the cost of <i>heat</i>. He is wrong in his treatment of
his manures, for he loses more than one half of their
value from evaporation, fermentation, and leaching.
He is wrong in not having water at hand for his
cattle&mdash;their exercise detracts from their accumulation
of fat and their production of heat, and it exposes
them to cold. He is wrong in not protecting
his fattening stock from the cold of winter; for,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
under exposure to cold, the food, which would
otherwise be used in the formation of <i>fat</i>, goes to
the production of the animal heat necessary to counteract
the chilling influence of the weather, p. 50.
He is wrong in allowing his manure to lie unprotected
in the barn-yard. He is wrong in not
adding to his tools the deep surface plow, the subsoil
plow, the cultivator, and many others of improved
construction. He is wrong in cultivating
with the plow and hoe, those crops which could be
better or more cheaply managed with the cultivator
or horse-hoe. He is wrong in many things more, as
we shall see if we examine all of his yearly routine of
work. He is right in a few things; and but a few,
as he himself would admit, had he that knowledge
of his business which he could obtain in the leisure
hours of a single winter. Still, he thinks himself a
<i>practical</i> farmer. In twenty years, we shall have
fewer such, for our young men have the mental
capacity and mental energy necessary to raise them
to the highest point of practical education, and to
that point they are gradually but surely rising.</p>

<p>Let us now place this same farm in the hands of
an educated and understanding cultivator; and, at
the end of five years, look at it again.</p>

<p>He has sold one half of it, and cultivates but fifty
acres. The money for which the other fifty were
sold has been used in the improvement of the farm.
The land has all been under-drained, and shows the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
many improvements consequent on such treatment.
The stones and small rocks have been removed,
leaving the surface of the soil smooth, and allowing
the use of the sub-soil plow, which with the under-drains
have more than doubled the productive power
of the farm. Sufficient labor is employed to cultivate
with improved tools, extensive root crops,
and they invariably give a large yield. The grass
land produces a yearly average of 2&frac12; tons of hay per
acre. From 80 to 100 bushels of corn, 30 bushels
of wheat, and 45 bushels of oats are the average of
the crops reaped. The soil has been analyzed, and
put in the best possible condition, while it is yearly
supplied with manures containing every thing taken
away in the abundant crops. The analysis is never
lost sight of in the regulation of crops and the application
of manures. The <i>worthless</i> muck bed was retained,
and is made worth one dollar a load to the
compost heap, especially as the land requires an
increase of organic matter. A new barn has been
built large enough to store all of the hay produced
on the farm. It has stables, which are tight and
warm, and are well ventilated <i>above</i> the cattle. The
stock being thus protected from the loss of their heat,
give more milk, and make more fat on a less amount
of food than they did under the old system. Water
is near at hand, and the animals are not obliged to
over exercise. The manure is carefully composted,
either under a shed constructed for the purpose with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
a tank and pump, or is thrown into the cellar below,
where the hogs mix it with a large amount of muck,
which has been carted in after being thoroughly decomposed
by the lime and salt mixture.</p>

<p>They are thus protected against all loss, and are
prepared for the immediate use of crops. No manures
are allowed to lie in the barn-yard, but they
are all early removed to the compost heap, where
they are preserved by being mixed with carbonaceous
matter. In the tool shed, we find deep surface-plows,
sub-soil plows, cultivators, horse-hoes, seed-drills,
and many other valuable improvements.</p>

<p>This farmer takes one or more agricultural papers,
from which he learns many new methods of cultivation,
while his knowledge of the <i>reasons</i> of various
agricultural effects enables him to discard the injudicious
suggestions of mere <i>book farmers</i> and uneducated
dreamers.</p>

<p>Here are two specimens of farmers. Neither
description is over-drawn. The first is much more
careful in his operations than the majority of our
rural population. The second is no better than
many who may be found in America.</p>

<p>We appeal to the common sense of the reader of
this work to know which of the two is the <i>practical
farmer</i>&mdash;let him imitate either as his judgment
shall dictate.</p>

<hr />

<p>It is now beyond a question, from the complete triumph over
all other machines this season, that this is the <i>only</i> successful Grass
Cutter known. It is in fact the <i>only</i> machine that has ever cut
<i>all kinds of grass</i> without <i>clogging</i> or <i>interruption</i>. More than
1000 have been sold the present season under the following warranty,
and not in a single instance have we been called on to take
one back.</p>

<p>(Warranty:) That said machines are capable of Cutting and
Spreading, with one span of horses and driver, from ten to fifteen
acres per day, <i>of any kind of grass, heavy or light, wet or dry,
lodged or standing</i>, and do it as well as is done with a scythe by
the best mowers.</p>

<p>The price of our machine, with two sets of knives and extras,
is $110, cash, delivered on board of cars or boat, free of charge.</p>

<h2>The Chemistry of Common Life.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By</span> JAMES F. W. JOHNSTON, M.A., F.R.S.S. L. &amp; E., &amp;c.</p>

<p class="center">Author of "Lectures on Agricultural Chemistry and Geology," a
"Catechism of Agricultural Chemistry and Geology," &amp;c.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The common life of man is full of wonders, Chemical and Physiological. Most of us pass
through this life without seeing or being sensible of them, though every day our existence and
our comforts ought to recall them to our minds. One main cause of this is, that our schools
tell us nothing about them&mdash;do not teach those parts of modern learning which would fit us
for seeing them. What most concerns the things that daily occupy our attention and cares,
are in early life almost sedulously kept from our knowledge. Those who would learn any
thing regarding them, must subsequently teach themselves through the help of the press:
hence the necessity for a Popular Chemical Literature.</p>

<p>It is with a view to meet this want of the Public, and at the same time to supply a Manual
for the Schools, that the present work has been projected. It treats, in what appears to be
their natural order, of <span class="smaller">THE AIR WE BREATHE</span> and <span class="smaller">THE WATER WE DRINK</span>, in their relations to
human life and health&mdash;<span class="smaller">THE SOIL WE CULTIVATE AND THE PLANT WE REAR</span>, as the sources
from which the chief sustenance of all life is obtained&mdash;<span class="smaller">THE BREAD WE EAT AND THE BEEF WE
COOK</span>, as the representatives of the two grand divisions of human food&mdash;<span class="smaller">THE BEVERAGES WE
INFUSE</span>, from which so much of the comfort of modern life, both savage and civilized, is derived&mdash;<span class="smaller">THE
SWEETS WE EXTRACT</span>, the history of which presents so striking an illustration of
the economical value of chemical science&mdash;<span class="smaller">THE LIQUORS WE FERMENT</span>, so different from the
sweets in their action on the system, and yet so closely connected with them in chemical
history&mdash;<span class="smaller">THE NARCOTICS WE INDULGE IN</span>, as presenting us with an aspect of the human constitution
which, both chemically and physiologically, is more mysterious and wonderful than
any other we are acquainted with&mdash;<span class="smaller">THE ODOURS WE ENJOY AND THE SMELLS WE DISLIKE</span>; the
former because of the beautiful illustration it presents of the recent progress of organic
chemistry in its relations to comforts of common life, and the latter because of its intimate
connection with our most important sanitary arrangements&mdash;<span class="smaller">WHAT WE BREATHE FOR</span> and
<span class="smaller">WHY WE DIGEST</span>, as functions of the body at once the most important to life, and the most
purely chemical in their nature&mdash;<span class="smaller">THE BODY WE CHERISH</span>, as presenting many striking phenomena,
and performing many interesting chemical functions not touched upon in the discussion
of the preceding topics&mdash;and lastly, <span class="smaller">THE CIRCULATION OF MATTER</span>, as exhibiting in
one view the end, purpose, and method of all the changes in the natural body, in organic
nature, and in the mineral kingdom, which are connected with and determine the existence
of life.</p>

<p>It has been the object of the Author in this Work to exhibit the present condition of
chemical knowledge and of matured scientific opinion upon the subjects to which it is devoted.
The reader will not be surprised, therefore, should he find in it some things which
differ from what is to be found in other popular works already in his hands or on the shelves
of his library.</p>

<p>The Work is being published in 5 or 6 <span class="smcap">Numbers</span>, price 25 cents each, in the following

<p>This Machine consists of a simple frame and box mounted
on wheels, in front of which is a cylinder, set with spiral
knives, acting in concert with curved spring teeth, in combination
with a straight knife, which forms a perfect shear, and
severs the head from the stalk; the heads are at the same time
discharged into the box. The teeth being made to spring and
vibrate, not a particle of clover, however stalky or thick, can
possibly escape being cut, or allow the teeth to become clogged.
The Cylinder and Knives are protected by an adjustible guard
plate, thus allowing only the heads to pass to the Knives, retaining
the head, and the head only&mdash;thus leaving the stalk to
enrich the soil. The machine is so constructed that it can be
made adjustible to the height of the Clover and Timothy.</p>

<p>To be seen at the Crystal Palace. Price of the machines
moderate.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The Farmer will find that by this process, he may save two crops of Timothy
per year. When the seed is ripe the tops can be clipped, and the straw left
until fall to mature. You now have your seed and hay in two crops of equal
value; in case of clover, you mow the first crop for hay, the second for seed;
you in both cases get better seed and hay with less labor and expense than
grain crops, at the same time leaving the soil clothed with a coat of straw, for
the coming season, which will increase the value of the soil for crops, make fine
pastures and fine stock, while it fits the land for fine grain. In this way lands
in our states have been raised in production from five to twenty-five or thirty
bushels of wheat per acre, in the course of a few years.</p>
